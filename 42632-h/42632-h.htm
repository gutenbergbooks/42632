<h2>GIBBON'S CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Bentinck Street, July 3rd, 1781.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>Though your kind impatience might make the time
appear tedious, there has been no other delay in my business,
than the necessary forms of Election. My new constituents of
Lymington obligingly chose me in my absence. I took my seat
last Wednesday, and am now so old a member that I begin to
complain of the heat and length of the Session. So much for
Parliament. With regard to the board of trade, I am ignorant of
your friend's meaning, and possibly she may be so herself. There
has not been (to my knowledge) the most distant idea of my
leaving it, and indeed there are few places within the compass of
any rational ambition that I should like so well.</p>

<p>In a few days, as soon as we are relieved from public business,
I shall go down to my Country house for the summer. Do
not stare. I say my Country house. Notwithstanding Caplin's
very diligent enquiries, I have not been able to please myself with
anything in the neighbourhood of London, and have therefore
hired for three months a small pleasant house at Brighthelmstone.
I flatter myself that in that admirable sea-air, with the vicinity of
Sheffield place, and a proper mixture of light study in the morning
and good company in the evening, the summer may roll away not
disagreably.&mdash;As I know your tender apprehensions, I promise you
not to bathe in the sea without due preparation and advice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porten has chosen, not for health but pleasure, a
different sea-shore: she has been some weeks at Margate, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
scarcely return to town before my departure. I sincerely
sympathize in all the melancholy scenes which have afflicted your
sensibility, and am more particularly concerned about poor Miss
Gould, to whom I wish to express the thoughts and hopes of
friendship on this melancholy occasion. Lady Miller's<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> sudden
death has excited some attention even in this busy World, her
foibles are mentioned with general regard. Adieu, Dear Madam,
and do not let Mrs. Ravaud tempt you into Elysium: we are
tolerably well here.</p>

<p>Nothing but my absence (on a visit to Mr. Jenkinson<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
in Surrey) should have prevented me from writing by the <em>first</em>
post to remove those fears which could be suggested only by
too exquisite a sensibility. I am well and happy; the modest
expression of <em>tolerably</em> was intended to express a very high degree
of content, and I most sincerely assure you that my journey to
Brighthelmstone is in search not of health but of amusement

<div class="sidenote">HIS HOUSE AT BRIGHTON.</div>

<p>After a short visit to Sheffield I came to this place last
Sunday evening, and think it will answer my expectations. My
house, which is not much bigger than yours, has a full prospect of
the sea and enjoys a temperate climate in the most sultry days.
The air gives health, spirits and a ravenous appetite. I walk
sufficiently morning and evening, lounge in the middle of the day
on the Steyne, booksellers' shops, &amp;c., and by the help of a pair
of horses can make more distant excursions. The society is good
and easy, and though I have a large provision of books for my
amusement, I shall not undertake any deep studies or laborious
compositions this summer. You will rejoyce, I am sure, in hearing
so favourable an account of my situation, and I wish I could
propose to you to share it with me.</p>

<p>Of all mortals I have the least right to complain of a

I am seriously alarmed. If you can assure me by a line that it
does not proceed from want of health or spirits, I shall be
perfectly at ease. Notwithstanding our princely visitors (the
Cumberlands) who are troublesome, I like the air and society so
well that I shall certainly stay here at least till the end of
September. Adieu.</p>

<p>Lord Hillsborough<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> tells me that himself and Co. believe
that the combined fleets are gone into Brest. Expresses that

<p>*Oh, ho! I have given you the slip; saved thirty miles, by
proceeding directly this day from Eartham to town, and am now

before <em>my own</em> fire; a style which you understand, though it is
unintelligible to your Lord. The town is empty; but I am
surrounded with a thousand old acquaintance of all ages and
characters, who are ready to answer a thousand questions which
I am impatient to ask. I shall not easily be tired of their
Company; yet I still remember, and will honourably execute, my
promise of visiting you at Brighton about the middle of next
month. I have seen nobody, nor learned anything, in four hours
of a town life; but I can inform you, that Lady * * * [erased]
is now the declared mistress of Prince Henry of Prussia, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
she encountered at Spa; and that the Emperor has invited this
amiable Couple to pass the winter at Vienna; fine encouragement
for married women who behave themselves properly! I spent a

know Lord S. Adieu. I cordially embrace, &amp;c.*</p>

<p>The last ten years by your advice I ensured my farm buildings

£50.&mdash;If any ideas occur to you, communicate your instructions,

Brighthelmstone, Nov. 2nd, 1781.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>If I had not been fortified by the friendly assurances
which you sent me, I should indeed have been alarmed by the
melancholy account that I heard of your health as soon as I
arrived in Sussex. Since that time (an interval somewhat too
long) I have been gradually better satisfied with the frequent
and favourable dispatches from Bath, and I have now the satisfaction
to find (however I might suspect your own friendly dissimulation)
that even in Mr. H.'s apprehensive fancy you have
in a great measure recovered that situation which I wish you
long to preserve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIGHTON IN NOVEMBER.</div>

<p>*I returned to this place with Lord and Lady Sheffield, with
the design of passing two or three weeks in a situation which
had so highly delighted me. But how vain are all sublunary
hopes! I had forgot that there is some difference between the
sunshine of August and the cold fogs (though we have uncommon
good weather) of November. Instead of my beautiful sea-shore,
I am confined to a dark lodging in the middle of the town; for
the place is still full, and our time is now spent in the dull
imitation of a London life. To compleat my misfortunes, Lord
S. was hastily ordered to Canterbury, to suppress smuggling, and
I was left almost alone with My Lady, in the servile state of a
married man. But he returns to-day, and I hope to be seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in my own library by the middle of next week. However, you
will not be sorry to hear that I have refreshed myself by a very
<em>idle</em> summer, and indeed a much idler and more pleasant winter
than the house of Commons will ever allow me to enjoy again.*</p>

<p>I hear of no public changes of administration, but you are
perhaps already informed that a grand officer of my household
(Mrs. Ford) at length retires on a pension, her wages for her life,
with which she seems well contented, though I am ignorant of
her plans. Mrs. Porten opened the business to her, but I have
not yet sustained the last tender interview which I really dislike
very much. Caplin assumes with pleasure the office of prime
minister, and we hope that some lessons at White's will turn the
housemaid (Edward's sister) into a good Cook for private ordinary
days.</p>

<p>*I had almost forgot Mr. Hayley; ungratefully enough,
since I really past a very simple, but entertaining day with him.
His place, though small, is elegant as his mind, which I value
much more highly.* And Adam might be happy if Eve had never
been admitted into the paradise of Eartham. She is resolved
(the air of Eartham after fifteen years' residence is found to be
too cold) to eat another Bath apple, which as you properly
apprehend will not be very wholesome either for her fame or
his fortune. *Mrs. H. wrote a melancholy story of an American
mother, a friend of her friend, who in a short time had lost three
sons: one killed by the savages, one run mad from the fright at
that accident, and the third taken at sea, now in England a prisoner
in Forton hospital. For <em>him</em> something might perhaps be done.
Your humanity will prompt you to obtain from Mrs. H. a more
accurate account of names, dates, and circumstances; but you
will prudently suppress my request, lest I should raise hopes
which it may not be in my power to gratify. Lady S. begs to
send her kindest Compliments to you.* The persons of Bath by
whom and to whom I wish to be remembered are Mrs. Ravaud
and the Goulds. What is become of poor Sir John Miller? I
foresee very little prospect of visiting Bath at Christmas, but I
depend, perhaps with too much confidence, on next Easter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS ADVICE IN A QUARREL.</div>

<p>I have seen the General. You are both wrong; he first in
lending your papers without <em>special</em> leave, and then in the real or
apparent slight of your messages; you in the serious anger which
you expressed on so trifling a business. Unless you wish that this
slight scratch should inflame into an incurable sore, embrace the
lucky opportunity of his illness and confinement, which will excuse
your dignity and should assuage your resentment. Call on him
this evening, give and receive, between jest and earnest, a volley

Bentinck Street, November 20th, 1781.
</p>

<p>I came yesterday from Jenkinson's (near Croydon), where I
had spent two very agreeable days. We all tremble on the edge
of a precipice, and whatever may be the event, the American war
seems now to be reduced to very narrow compass both of time
and place.</p>

<p>This morning Caplin was sent to reconnoitre: he reports
that the <em>stables</em> are empty, but as the <em>coach-house</em> is full, the
close alliance between carriage and horses will render the former
circumstance of little avail. Nothing can be had in Parliament
Street or the large streets adjoining except one whole house at
four Guineas per week. In Fludyer and Downing-streets several
indifferent and gloomy lodgings are at your service, but as I
should prefer a Pall Mall, &amp;c. situation, Caplin has paused till
you send him more peremptory commands.&mdash;Your Monday dinner
will be ready at five, and Adam, perhaps Batt, will be of the
party.</p>

<p>Your Greeks were not carried from Brighton through carelessness,
but as you are <em>seriously</em> absurd about lending books,
I have directed Caplin to send them to S. P. per coach. By
way of revenge I may inform you that I have now purchased a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
copy of Stephen's Greek Poets compared to which yours is very
little more than waste paper. Adieu.</p>

</p>

<p>I wish most sincerely that it were in my power to give
you or myself any comfort on the present state of public affairs,
which is indeed deplorable and I fear <em>hopeless</em>. But at last I
can send you a favourable account of myself: the late, hot,
melancholy hours of the house of Commons,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which seem to
oppress every body round me, have no effect on my health or
spirits, and I feel myself heartily tired (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyé</i>) without being
in the least fatigued. Of Mrs. P. I shall say nothing, as by
this time you will have seen her brother and his wife, who set
out this morning for Bath. A month without business will be a
new and wholesome scene for Sir Stanier. I hear nothing, and
want to hear something of Mrs. Hayley. You have heard of
Lady Worsley; your old acquaintance Sir Richard labours with
copious materials for a divorce.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NOISE AND NONSENSE OF PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>As Sheffelina has modernized herself by securing an unknown
Cicisbeo, I have a great mind to propose a partie quarrée which
might be easily furnished from Ickworth. If that project is
rejected and I must make a solitary visit, I shall still obey the
gracious mandate, but instead of the third day of the year (may
it be more auspicious) 1782, I must delay my attendance till
about the 8th or even the tenth, which will still allow me eight
or ten days of fresh air and friendly converse, before I again
descend into the noise and nonsense of the Pandemonium. At
present we are as quiet in London as you can be in Sussex.
Mrs. Stuart's shocking adventure is the only event that enlivens
conversation; the family whisper insanity (a terrible resource),
and strive without success to persuade that the whole scene passed
only in her imagination&mdash;yet she certainly passed the whole night
abroad. I did suppose that the Baron would be tired of his
home in a week, but as this visit to the Regiment will abridge
the remaining interval he may possibly support it. I hear
nothing more of the house in D. S., but still believe that the
minister will retire before your superior majesty;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the last time
I saw him he expressed great apprehension of your displeasure.
I too am in pursuit of a house, in Harley Street, somewhat
further in the country than my own: it has but one fault, a steep
narrow staircase, but where must we seek (except at &mdash;&mdash;) either
a house or a wife without <em>one</em> fault? I embrace the Angels,
Princesses, &amp;c. I believe the elder had rather be a Princess than
an Angel. Adieu.</p>

<p>I am much afraid that I have lost all credit by repeated

you are glad to hear, though in two lines, of my health and good
spirits, and that you will postpone more ample conversations to
the Easter Holydays, when I can talk more in an hour than I

this scrap of an Epistle, were I not apprehensive that the

of my having got a house in Harley Street and a wreck of wine

the latter related to my aunt's manor of Newhaven, but the wine

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>From the very strong expressions of <em>anxious expectation</em>and frequent disappointments, I must think that I am much
more guilty than I conceived myself to be on account of my
silence. Your apparent indulgence had taught me to believe
that you were accustomed to my faults, that you kindly forgave
them, and that without the aid of the pen or the post your own
heart would inform you of the sentiments of mine. Since my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
last letter nothing has happened, indeed nothing can happen to
affect my situation: in the midst of a plague (such is the present
influenza) my health and spirits are perfectly good, and in that
tranquil state Saturdays and <em>Mondays</em> pass away without waking
me from my gentle slumber. Even my curiosity is not excited,
as I have frequent opportunities of hearing circumstantial and
impartial accounts of the only object that interests me at Bath.</p>

<p>You ask with some anxiety when you may hope to see me. I
know not what to say. Though I always foresee and recollect
with heartfelt satisfaction the time which I spend at the Belvidere,
yet the convenient season of my visit seems to retire before me.
Public events have immoderately protracted the present session
of Parliament; it will certainly continue the whole of June and
a considerable part of July, and as it was my intention to attend
it to the last, I began to think that you would excuse me if I
delayed my journey (which would suit me far better) till the
beginning of Autumn. But if you have any particular reasons
that make you wish to see me sooner, say it in ten lines, and I will
set off in ten days. I rejoyce in every subject of your joy both
private and public, and I am better pleased to hear that you are
free from pain than that Rodney has destroyed a French fleet.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>

<p>*I hope you have not had a moment's uneasiness about
the delay of my Midsummer letter. Whatever may happen, you
may rest fully secure, that the materials of it shall always be
<em>found</em>. But on this occasion I have missed four or five posts;
postponing, as usual, from morning to the evening bell, which
now rings, till it has occurred to me, that it might not be amiss
to inclose the two essential lines, if I only added that the
Influenza has been known to me only by the report of others.
Lord Rockingham<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is at last dead; a good man, though a feeble
minister: his successor is not yet named, and divisions in the
Cabinet are suspected. If Lord Shelburne should be the Man, as
I think he will, the friends of his predecessor will quarrel with
him before Christmas. At all events, I foresee much tumult and
strong opposition, from which I should be very glad to extricate
myself, by quitting the H. of C. with honour and without loss.
Whatever you may hear, I believe there is not the least intention
of dissolving Parliament, which would indeed be a rash and
dangerous measure.</p>

<p>I hope you like Mr. Hayley's poem;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he rises with his subject,
and since Pope's death, I am satisfied that England has not seen
so happy a mixture of strong sense and flowing numbers. Are
you not delighted with his address to his mother? I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that She was, in plain prose, every thing that he speaks her in
verse. This summer I shall stay in town, and work at my trade,
till I make some Holydays for my Bath excursion. Lady S. is
at Brighton, and he lives under tents, like the wild Arabs; so

<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,

<p>A person whom you would scarcely suspect, General
Conway as commander in Chief, is the real author of my silence,
which as usual has insensibly lasted far beyond my first intentions.
Lord Sheffield is a slave, his master's resolutions are obscure
and fluctuating, and I have waited from post to post till he
could mark some week for our meeting in Sussex, which might
leave the rest of my time at liberty for my Bath expedition.
Though I can obtain no satisfaction from him, I must not suffer
another <em>Monday</em> to slide away without saying that I am alive, well,
and unless the Arab should seize (<em>he</em> has no choice) that particular
moment, in full expectation of gratifying my wishes by
a visit to Bath about the 20th of next month. I flatter myself
that I shall find you not affected by the long winter which we
still feel, though a friend of mine, an Astronomer, assured me
that yesterday was the last of the dog days.</p>

<p>It is impossible to know what to say of our public affairs,
and the most knowing are only such by the knowledge of their
ignorance. The next session of Parliament will be the warmest
and most irregular battle that has ever been fought in that
place, and each man (except some leaders) is at the moment
uncertain of the party which inclination, opinion, or connection
will prompt him to embrace. You see that Mr. Eliot, or at
least his family, are become courtiers; his son (a very unmeaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
youth) is a Lord of the Treasury, an office which was formerly
the reward of twenty years' able and faithful service. The
Minister has not lost, for he never possessed, the public confidence,
and Lord N[orth], if he chuses to act, has the balance
of the country in his hands. A propos of the Eliots they are
still in town. We meet seldom, but with the utmost propriety
and equal regard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMMERSED IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE.</div>

<p>My private life is a gentle and not unpleasing continuation
of my old labours, and I am again involved, as I shall be for some
years, in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Some fame,
some profit, and the assurance of daily amusement encourage me
to persist. I am glad you are pleased with Mr. Hayley's poem;
perhaps he might have been less diffuse, but his sense is fine and
his verse is harmonious.&mdash;Mrs. Porten is just returned from a six
weeks' excursion in lodgings at Windsor, which she enjoyed (the
Terrace, the Air, and the Royal family) with all the spirit of
youth. Her elder brother is quiet in his new employment and
apartments in Kensington palace. I envy him the latter, and
had there been no Revolution I might have obtained a similar
advantage. At present I am on the ground, but the weather may

</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>As you suffered by the long winter, I may reasonably,
as I warmly, hope that your health and spirits have been permanently
restored by the milder Spring or Autumn which this
month has introduced:&mdash;For many reasons you will be surprised,
though I think pleased, to hear that I have fixed myself for this
season in a country villa of Hampton court. My friend Mr.
Hamilton (I must distinguish him by the impertinent epithet
of 'single speech') has very obligingly lent me a ready furnished
house close to the Palace, and opening by a private door into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Royal garden, which is maintained for my use but not at my
expence. The air and exercise, good roads and neighbourhood,
the opportunity of being in London at any time in two hours,
and the temperate mixture of society and study, adapt this new
scene very much to my wishes, and must entirely remove your
kind apprehensions of my injuring my health (which I have
never done) by excessive labour. I find or make many acquaintance,
and among others I have visited your old friend Mrs.
Manhood (Ashby) at Isleworth in her pleasant summer-house
on the Thames. She overwhelms me with civility, but you need
not indulge either hopes or fears: as I hear she is going to
accept Sir William Draper<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> for her third husband.</p>

<p>You will naturally suppose, and will not I think be displeased
that I should enjoy this new and unexpected situation as long as
the fine weather continues, and our past hardships encourage us
to depend on the favour, at least the first favours of the month of
October. Beyond that period the prospect in every sense of the
word is cloudy, and my future motions will be partly regulated
by parliament, and the intanglement of some private pursuits with
public affairs. I still flatter myself with the hope of securing
two or three weeks for Bath; but if I should <em>again</em> delay that
visit till Christmas, I shall prove my perfect confidence in your
indulgent friendship, and in your firm belief of my tender attachment,
which can alone justify such freedom of conduct. Of the
Sheffields I know little, seldom hear from, and am totally ignorant
when I shall see them. The Eliots are gone into Cornwall.
They <em>say</em> that the son is going to marry Lady Sarah Pitt,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> sister

<div class="sidenote">HIS HAMPTON COURT VILLA.</div>

<p>I should like sometimes to hear whether you survive the scenes
of action and danger in which a Dragoon is continually involved.
What a difference between the life of a Dragoon and that of a
Philosopher! and I will freely own that I (the Philosopher) am
much better satisfied with my own independent and tranquil
situation, in which I have always something to do, without ever
being obliged to do any thing. The Hampton Court Villa has
answered my expectation, and proved no small addition to my
comforts; so that I am resolved next summer to hire, borrow, or
steal, either the same, or something of the same kind. Every
morning I walk a mile or more before breakfast, read and write
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum sufficit</i>, mount my chaise and visit in the neighbourhood,
accept some invitations, and escape others, use the Lucans as my
daily bread, dine pleasantly at home or sociably abroad, reserve for
study an hour or two in the evening, lye in town regularly once a
week, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I have anounced to Mrs. G. my new Arrangements;
the certainty that October will be fine, and my encreasing
doubts whether I shall be able to reach Bath before Christmas.
Do you intend (but how can you <em>intend</em> any thing?) to pass the
winter under Canvas? Perhaps under the veil of Hampton Court
I may lurk ten days or a fortnight at Sheffield, if the enraged
Lady or cat does not shut the doors against me.</p>

<p>The Warden<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> passed through in his way to Dover. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not so fat, and more chearful than ever. I had not any private
conversation with him; but he clearly holds the balance; unless
he falls asleep and lets it fall from his hand. The Pandæmonium
(as I understand) does not meet till the 26th of November. I
feel with you that a nich is grown of higher value, but think <em>that</em>
only an additional argument for disposing of it. And so by this
time Lord L.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> is actually turned off. Do you know his partner
(Miss Courtenay, the Lord's sister), about thirty, only £4000,
not handsome, but very pleasant. I am at a loss where to address
my condoleance, I would say congratulation. Town is more a
desert than I ever knew it. I arrived yesterday, dined at Sir
Joshua's with a tolerable party; the chaise is now at the door;
I dine at Richmond, lye at Hampton, &amp;c. Adieu.</p>

<p>I feel your anxiety, and am impatient to assure you
that the report of your officious visitor is absolutely without

this place; but the air, exercise and dissipation have given me
fresh spirits; and I should be apt to fix on the last month as the
part of my life in which I have enjoyed the most perfect health.
You may depend on my word of honour, that in case of any real
alarm, you shall hear from myself or from Caplen.&mdash;Excuse
brevity, as I save a day, perhaps more, by sending Caplen with
Duplicates to London, one copy for the post, the other to take the
chance of greater dispatch by the coach. I wish to know what

</p>

<div class="sidenote">RELIEF OF GIBRALTAR.</div>

<p>*On the approach of winter, my paper house of Hampton
becomes less comfortable; my visits to Bentinck Street grow
longer and more frequent, and the end of next week will restore
me to the town, with a lively wish, however, to repeat the same,
or a similar experiment, next Summer. I admire the assurance
with which you propose a month's residence at Sheffield, when
you are not sure of being allowed three days. Here it is currently
reported, that Camps will not separate till Lord Howe's <em>return</em>
from Gibraltar,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and as yet we have no news of his arrival.
Perhaps, indeed, you have more intimate correspondence with
your old school-fellow, Lord Shelburne, and already know the
hour of your deliverance. I should like to be informed. As
Lady S. has entirely forgot me, I shall have the pleasure of forming
a new acquaintance. I have often thought of writing, but it
is now too late to repent.</p>

<p>I am at a loss what to say or think about our Parliamentary
state. A certain late Secretary of Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the husband of Polly
Jones, reckons the House of Commons thus: Minister 140,
Reynard 90, Boreas 120, the rest unknown, or uncertain. The
last of the three, by self or agents, talks too much of absence,
neutrality, moderation. I still think he will discard the game.</p>

<p>I am not in such a fury with the letter of American independence;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
but it seems ill-timed and useless; and I am much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
entertained with the Metaphysical disputes between Government
and secession about the meaning of it. Lord Lough[borough]
will be in town Sunday sen-night. I long to see him and Co.
I think he will take a very decided part. If he could throw
aside his Gown, he would make a noble Leader. The East India
news are excellent; the French gone to the Mauritius, Heyder
desirous of peace, the Nizam and Mahrattas our friends, and 70
Lack of Rupees in the Bengal treasury, while we were voting the
recall of Hastings.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Adieu. Write soon.</p>

<p>Although I am provoked (it is always right to begin first)
with your long and unaccountable silence, yet I cannot help
wishing (a foolish weakness) to learn whether you and the two
infants are still alive, and what have been the summer amusements
of your widowed and their orphan state. Some indirect
intelligence inclines me to suspect that the Baron himself has
quitted before this time a house of Canvas for one of brick, and
that he enjoys a short interval between the fatigues of War
and those of Government. Should he happen to find himself in
your neighbourhood you may inform him that Hugonin (good
creature) came to town purposely on my business and passed three
hours with me this morning. Harris has resigned his Case of the
conflagration, and either by a sale to Lord Stawell or by a new
Tenant we shall make it rather a profitable affair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENTHUSIASM FOR SIR GEORGE ELIOTT.</div>

<p>You have doubtless received very accurate accounts of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

obtained very frequent narratives of your life and conversation,
and this mutual Gazette has contributed not a little to stifle
the reproaches of my conscience. In my excursions round the
Hampton neighbourhood, I have often visited and dined with
them, and found him properly sensible of his happyness in the
absence of his wife: indeed I never saw a man more improved by
any fortunate event. My campaign, and it has been a pleasant
one, is now closed, but in the time which remains before the
opening of our Pandemonium, I should not dislike to breathe
for a week or ten days the air of Sheffield Place, and as the
Lord will be accessible in town before Christmas, my attack
(according to modern rules) will be chiefly designed for the
Lady. About Wednesday or Thursday next would be the day
that I should think of moving, but I wish to be informed how

<p>Last week I finished my Hampton Court expedition,
and think myself obliged to the person and to the accident which
have thrown that unexpected but not unpleasing variety into my
Summer life. I am now fixed in town till Christmas, or if Lord
Sheffield who has quitted his camp should drag me into Sussex, it
can be only for three or four days.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary campaign is approaching very fast,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and a
very singular one it must be from the conflict of <em>three</em> parties,
each of which will be exposed in its turn to the direct or oblique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
attacks of the other two. As a matter of curiosity I shall derive
some gratification from my silent seat, but at present I do not
perceive its use in any other light. From honour, gratitude and
principle I am and shall be attached to Lord N., who will lead a
very respectable force into the field, but I much doubt whether
matters are ripe for either conquest or coalition, and the havock
which Burke's bill has made of places, &amp;c., encreases the difficulties
of a new arrangement. However a month or two may
change the face of things, and the faces of men.</p>

connection public or private with the son. Yet we cannot refuse
to admire a youth of four and twenty whom eloquence and real
merit have already made Chancellor of the Exchequer without his
promotion occasioning either surprize or censure.</p>

Siddons:<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> two years ago, and in the part of Lady Townley,
she did not strike me: but I saw her last night with the most
exquisite pleasure. She gave sense and spirit to a wretched play
(the Fatal Marriage), and displayed every power of voice, action,
and countenance to a degree which left me nothing to wish. To-morrow
I promise myself still more satisfaction from Jane Shore,
as the character is more worthy of her talents. Adieu, Dear

<p>*As I arrived about five o'Clock on Wednesday last, we were
some time in town in mutual ignorance. Unlucky enough: yet
our loss will be speedily repaired. Your reason for not writing is
worthy of an Irish Baron. You thought Sarah might be at Bath,
because you directed letters to her at Clifton, near Bristol; where
indeed I saw her in a delightful situation, swept by the winter
winds, and scorched by the summer sun. A nobler reason for
your silence would be the care of the public papers, to record
Your steps, words, and actions. I was pleased with your Coventry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
oration: a panegyric on the Hertford family<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> is a subject entirely
new, and which no orator before yourself would have dared to
undertake. You have acted with prudence and dignity in casting
away the military yoke,* yet even if I <em>had</em> a right I should try to
moderate my indignation. *This next summer you will sit down
(if you can sit) in the long-lost character of a country Gentleman.</p>

<p>For my own part, my late journey has only confirmed me in
the opinion, that No. 7 Bentinck-street is the best house in the

Next week<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> we shall probably hear some questions on that head

reproches, comme si nous allions reprendre la conversation
familière du jour précédent. Si je proposois de faire un <em>compte

juger sur mes réminiscences et sur le rapport de l'ami Bugnon,
vous aimez aussi peu la puissance de l'Angleterre que celle des
Romains. Notre chute, cependant, a été plus douce. Après une
guerre sans succès, et une paix assez peu glorieuse, il nous reste
de quoi vivre contens et heureux; et lorsque je me suis dépouillé
du rôle de Membre du Parlement, pour redevenir homme,
philosophe, et historien, nous pourrions bien nous trouver
d'accord sur la plupart des scènes étonnantes qui viennent de se
passer devant nos yeux, et qui fourniront une riche matière aux
plus habiles de mes successeurs.</p>

<p>Bornons nous à cette heure à un objet moins illustre sans
doute, mais plus intéressant pour tous les deux, et c'est beaucoup
que le même objet puisse intéresser deux mortels qui ne se sont
pas vûs, qui à peine se sont écrit depuis&mdash;oui, ma foi&mdash;depuis
huit ans. Ma plume, très paresseuse au commencement, ou
plutôt avant le commencement, marche assez vîte, lorsqu'elle

souvient, Seigneur, que mon grandpère a fait sa fortune, que mon
père l'a mangée avec un peu trop d'appétit, et que je jouis

serviteur chassé, et le <em>Board</em> même, dont j'étois membre, aboli
et cassé pour toujours par la réformation de M. Burke, avec
beaucoup d'autres places de l'Etat, et de la maison du Roi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS VIEW OF ENGLISH POLITICS.</div>

<p>Pour mon malheur, je suis toujours resté Membre de la Chambre
basse: à la fin du dernier Parlement (en 1780) M. Eliot à retiré
sa nomination; mais la faveur de Milord North a facilité ma
rentrée, et la reconnoissance m'imposoit le devoir de faire valoir,
pour son service, les droits que je tenois en partie de lui. Cet
hyver nous avons combattu sous les étendards réunis (vous savez
notre histoire) de Milord North et de M. Fox; nous avons
triomphé de Milord Shelburne et de la paix,* et mon ami (je
n'aime pas à profaner ce nom) a remonté sur sa bête en qualité
de secretaire d'Etat. C'est à présent qu'il peut bien me dire
ç'etoit beaucoup pour moi, ce n'etoit rien pour nous, et malgré
les assurances les plus fortes, j'ai trop de raison pour avoir de
la foi. *Avec beaucoup d'esprit, et des qualités très respectables,
notre homme* a la demarche lente et le c&oelig;ur froid. Il *n'a plus
ni le titre, ni le crédit de premier ministre; des collègues plus
actifs lui enlèvent les morceaux les plus friands, qui sont aussitôt
dévorés par la voracité de leurs créatures; nos malheurs et nos
réformes ont diminué le nombre des graces; par orgueil ou par
paresse, je solicite assez mal, et si je parviens enfin, ce sera
peut-être à la veille d'une nouvelle révolution, qui me fera
perdre dans un instant, ce qui m'aura coûté tant de soins et
de recherches.</p>

<p>Si je ne consultois que mon c&oelig;ur et ma raison, je romprois
sur le champ cette indigne chaine de la dépendance; je
quitterois le Parlement, Londres, l'Angleterre; je chercherois
sous un ciel plus doux, dans un pays plus tranquille, le repos,
la liberté, l'aisance, et une société éclairée, et aimable. En
attendant la mort de ma belle-mere et de ma tante je coulerois
quelques années de ma vie sans espérance, et sans crainte,
j'acheverais mon histoire, et je ne rentrerois dans ma patrie
qu'en homme libre, riche, et respectable par sa position, aussi
bien que par son caractère. Mes amis, et surtout Milord Sheffield,
(M. Holroyd) ne veulent pas me permettre d'être heureux suivant
mon goût et mes lumières. Leur prudence exige que je fasse
tous mes efforts, pour obtenir un emploi très sûr à la vérité,
qui me donneroit mille guinées de rente, mais qui m'enleveroit
cinq jours par semaine. Je me prête à leur zèle, et je leur ai
promis de ne partir qu'en automne, après avoir consacré l'été
à cette dernière tentative. Le succès, cependant, est très incertain,
et je ne sais si je le désire de bonne foi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Si je parviens à me voir exilé, mon choix ne sera pas douteux.
Lausanne a eu mes prémices; elle me sera toujours chère par le
doux souvenir de ma jeunesse. Au bout de trente ans, je me
rappelle les polissons qui sont aujourd'hui juges, les petites filles
de la société du Printems, qui sont devenues grand-mères. Votre
pays est charmant, et, malgré le dégoût de Jean Jacques, les
m&oelig;urs, et l'esprit de ses habitans, me paroissent très assortis aux
bords du lac Léman. Mais un trésor que je ne trouverois qu'à
Lausanne, c'est un ami qui me convient également par les
sentimens et les idées, avec qui je n'ai jamais connu un instant
d'ennui, de sécheresse, ou de réserve. Autrefois dans nos libres
épanchemens, nous avons cent fois fait le projet de vivre ensemble,
et cent fois nous avons épluché tous les détails du Roman, avec
une chaleur qui nous étonnoit nous mêmes. A présent il demeure,
ou plutôt vous demeurez, (car je me lasse de ce ton étudié,) dans
une maison charmante et commode; je vois d'ici mon appartement,
nos salles communes, notre table, et nos promenades; mais ce
marriage ne vaut rien, s'il ne convient pas également aux deux
époux, et je sens combien des circonstances locales, des goûts
nouveaux, de nouvelles liaisons, peuvent s'opposer aux desseins,
qui nous ont paru les plus agréables dans le lointain. Pour fixer
mes idées, et pour nous épargner des regrets, il faut me dévoiler
avec la franchise dont je vous ai donné l'exemple, le tableau
extérieur et intérieur de George Deyverdun. Mon amour est
trop délicat, pour supporter l'indifférence et les égards, et je
rougirois d'un bonheur dont je serois redevable, non à l'inclination,
mais à la fidélité de mon ami.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPOSES TO SETTLE ABROAD.</div>

<p>Pour m'armer contre les malheurs possibles, hélas! peut-être
trop vraisemblables, j'ai essayé de me détacher de la pensée
de ce projet favori, et de me représenter à Lausanne votre
bon voisin, sans être précisément votre commensal. Si j'y
étois réduit, je ne voudrois pas tenir maison, autant par raison
d'économie, que pour éviter l'ennui de manger seul. D'un autre
côté, une pension ouverte, fut-elle montée sur l'ancien pied de
celle de Mesery, ne conviendroit plus à mon age, ni à mon
caractère. Passerois-je ma vie au milieu d'une foule de jeunes
Anglois échappés du collège, moi qui aimerois Lausanne cent
fois davantage, si j'y pouvois être le seul de ma nation? Il
me faudroit donc une maison commode et riante, un état au
dessus de la bourgeoisie, un mari instruit, une femme qui ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ressembleroit pas à Madame Pavilliard, et l'assurance d'y être
reçu comme le fils unique, ou plutôt comme le frère de la famille.
Pour nous arranger sans gêne, je meublerai très volontiers un
joli appartement sous le même toit, ou dans le voisinage, et
puisque le ménage le plus foible laisse encore de l'étoffe pour une
forte pension, je ne serois pas obligé de chicaner sur les conditions
pécuniaires. Si je me vois déchu de cette dernière espérance,
je renoncerois en soupirant à ma seconde patrie, pour chercher
un nouvel asyle, non pas à Genève, triste séjour du travail et de
la discorde, mais aux bords du lac de Neufchatel, parmi les bons
Savoyards de Chamberry, ou sous le beau climat des Provinces
Méridionales de la France. Je finis brusquement, parceque j'ai
mille choses à vous dire. Je pense que nous nous ressemblons
pour la correspondance. Pour le bavardage savant ou même
amical, je suis de tous les hommes le plus paresseux, mais dès
qu'il s'agit d'un objet réel, d'un service essentiel, le premier
courier emporte toujours ma réponse. A la fin d'un mois, je
commencerai à compter les semaines, les jours, les heures. Ne
me les faites pas compter trop long tems. Vale.*</p>

<h2>461.</h2>

<h3><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Deyverdun à M. Gibbon.</i></h3>


<p class="head">
Strasbourg, le 10 Juin, 1783.
</p>

<p>*Je ne saurois vous exprimer, Monsieur et cher ami, la variété,
et la vivacité, des sensations que m'a fait éprouver votre lettre.
Tout cela a fini par un fond de plaisir et d'espérance qui resteront
dans mon c&oelig;ur, jusqu'à ce que vous les en chassiez.</p>

<p>Un rapport singulier de circonstances contribue à me faire
espérer que nous sommes destinés à vivre quelque tems agréablement
ensemble. Je ne suis pas dégoûté d'une ambition que je ne
connus jamais; mais par d'autres circonstances, je me trouve
dans la même situation d'embarras et d'incertitude où vous êtes
aussi à cette époque. Il y a un an que votre lettre, mon cher
ami, m'auroit fait plaisir sans doute, mais en ce moment, elle
m'en fait bien davantage; elle vient en quelque façon à mon
secours.</p>

<p>Depuis mon retour d'Italie, ne pouvant me déterminer à<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
vendre ma maison, m'ennuyant d'y être seul (car je suis comme
vous, Monsieur, et je déteste de manger sans compagnie) ne
voulant pas louer à des étrangers, j'ai pris le parti de m'arranger
assez joliment au premier étage, et de donner le second à une
famille de mes amis, qui me nourrit, et que je loge. Cet
arrangement a paru pendant longtems contribuer au bonheur
des deux parties. Mais tout est transitoire sur cette terre. Ma
maison sera vuide, selon toute apparence, sur la fin de l'été, et je
me vois d'avance tout aussi embarrassé et incertain, que je l'étois
il y a quelques années, ne sachant quelle nouvelle société choisir,
et assez disposé à vendre enfin cette possession qui m'a causé
bien des plaisirs et bien des peines. Ma maison<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> est donc à
votre disposition pour cet automne, et vous y arriveriez comme
un Dieu dans une machine qui finit l'embroglio. Voilà, quant
à moi; parlons de vous maintenant avec la même sincérité.</p>

<p>Un mot de préambule. Quelque intéressé que je sois à
votre résolution, convaincu qu'il faut aimer ses amis pour
eux-mêmes, sentant d'ailleurs combien il seroit affreux pour moi
de vous voir des regrets, je vous donne ici ma parole d'honneur,
que mon intérêt n'influe en rien sur ce que je vais écrire,
et que je ne dirai pas un mot que je ne vous disse, si
l'hermite de la grotte étoit un autre que moi. Vos amis anglais
vous aiment pour eux-mêmes; je ne veux moi que votre bonheur.
Rappellez-vous, mon cher ami, que je vis avec peine votre entrée
dans le Parlement, et je crois n'avoir été que trop bon prophète;
je suis sûr que cette carrière vous a fait éprouver plus de
privations que de jouissances, beaucoup plus de peines que de
plaisirs; j'ai cru toujours, depuis que je vous ai connu, que vous
étiez destiné à vivre heureux par les plaisirs du cabinet et de la
société, que tout autre marché étoit un écart de la route du
bonheur, et que ce n'étoit que les qualités réunies d'homme
de lettres, et d'homme aimable de société, qui pouvoient vous
procurer gloire, honneur, plaisirs, et une suite continuelle de
jouissances. Au bout de quelques tours dans votre salle, vous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sentirez parfaitement que j'avois bien vu, et que l'événement a
justifié mes idées.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEYVERDUN'S OFFER OF HIS HOUSE.</div>

<p>Lorsque j'ai appris que vous étiez <em>Lord of Trade</em>, j'en ai
été faché; quand j'ai su que vous aviez perdu cette place, je
m'en suis réjouis pour vous; quand on m'a annoncé que Milord
North étoit remonté sur sa bête, j'ai cru vous voir très mal
à votre aise, en croupe derrière lui, et je m'en suis affligé pour
vous. Je suis donc charmé, mon cher ami, de vous savoir à
pied, et je vous conseille très sincèrement de rester dans cette
position, et bien loin de solliciter la place en question, de
la refuser, si elle vous étoit offerte. Mille guinées vous
dédommageront-elles de cinq jours pris de la semaine? Je
suppose, ce que cependant j'ai peine à croire, que vous me disiez
que oui: et la variété et l'inconstance continuelle de votre
ministère, vous promettent-elles d'en jouir long tems constamment,
et n'est-il pas plus désagréable, mon cher Monsieur, de n'avoir
plus 1000 livres sterl. de rente, qu'il n'a été agréable d'en jouir?
D'ailleurs ne pourrez-vous pas toujours rentrer dans la carrière,
si l'ambition, ou l'envie de servir la patrie, vous reprennent; ne
rentrerez-vous pas avec plus d'honneur, lorsque vos rentes étant
augmentées naturellement, vous serez libre et indépendant?</p>

<p>En faisant cette retraite en Suisse, outre la beauté du pays,
et les agrémens de la société, vous acquererez deux biens que
vous avez perdus, la liberté et la richesse. Vous ne serez d'ailleurs
point inutile; vos ouvrages continueront à nous éclairer, et
indépendamment de vos talens, l'honnête homme, le galant
homme, n'est jamais inutile.</p>

<p>Il me reste à vous présenter le tableau que vous trouveriez.
Vous aimiez ma maison et mon jardin; c'est bien autre chose
à présent. Au premier étage qui donne sur la descente d'Ouchy,
je me suis arrangé un appartement qui me suffit, j'ai une
chambre de domestique, deux sallons, et deux cabinets. J'ai
au plein pied de la terrasse, deux autres sallons dont l'un sert
en été de salle à manger, et l'autre de sallon de compagnie. J'ai
fait un nouvel appartement de trois pièces dans le vuide entre
la maison et la remise, en sorte que j'ai à vous offrir tout le
grand appartement, qui consiste actuellement en onze pièces,
tant grandes que petites, tournées au Levant et au Midi, meublées
sans magnificence déplacée, mais avec une sorte d'élégance dont
j'espère que vous seriez satisfait. La terrasse a peu changé;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
mais elle est terminée par un grand cabinet mieux proportionné
que le précédent, garnie tout du long, de caisses d'orangers, &amp;c.
La treille, qui ne vous est pas indifférente, a embelli, prospéré,
et règne presqu'entièrement jusqu'au bout; parvenu à ce bout,
vous trouverez un petit chemin qui vous conduira à une
chaumière placée dans un coin; et de ce coin, en suivant le
long d'une autre route à l'anglaise, le mur d'un manège. Vous
trouverez au bout, un châlet avec écurie, vacherie, petite porte,
petit cabinet, petite bibliothèque, et une galerie de bois doré,
d'où l'on voit tout ce qui sort et entre en ville par la porte du
Chêne, et tout ce qui se passe dans ce Faubourg. J'ai acquis
la vigne au-dessous du jardin; j'en ai arraché tout ce qui étoit
devant la maison; j'en ai fait un tapis vert arrosé par l'eau du
jet d'eau; et j'ai fait tout autour de ce petit parc, une promenade
très variée par les différens points de vue et les objets même
intérieurs, tantôt jardin potager, tantôt parterre, tantôt vigne,
tantôt prés, puis châlet, chaumière, petite montagne; bref, les
étrangers viennent le voir et l'admirent, et malgré la description
pompeuse que je vous en fais, vous en serez content.</p>

<p>N. B. J'ai planté une quantité d'excellens arbres fruitiers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Venons à moi; vous comprenez bien que j'ai vieilli, excepté
pour la sensibilité; je suis à la mode, mes nerfs sont attaqués; je
suis plus mélancolique, mais je n'ai pas plus d'humeur; vous ne
souffrirez de mes maux que tout au plus négativement. Ensemble,
et séparés par nos logemens, nous jouirons, vis-à-vis l'un de
l'autre, de la plus grande liberté. Nous prendrons une gouvernante
douce et entendue, plutôt par commodité que par nécessité; car
je me chargerois sans crainte de la surintendance. J'ai fait
un ménage de quatre, pendant quelque tems; j'ai fait le
mien, et j'ai remarqué que cela marchoit tout seul, quand c'étoit
une fois en train. Les petites gens qui n'ont que ce mérite,
font grand bruit pour rien. Mon jardin nous fournira avec
abondance de bons fruits et d'excellens légumes. Pour le reste
de la table et de la dépense domestique, je ne demanderois pas
mieux que de vous recevoir chez moi, comme vous m'avez reçu
chez vous; mais nos situations sont différentes à cet égard;
cependant si vous étiez plus ruiné, je vous l'offrirois sans doute,
et je devrois le faire; mais avec les rentes que vous aviez, quand
j'étois chez vous, en les supposant même diminuées, vous vivrez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
très agréablement à Lausanne. Enfin à cet égard nous nous
arrangerons, comme il vous sera le plus agréable, et en proportion
de nos revenus. Toujours serez vous ainsi, à ce que j'espère,
plus décemment et plus comfortablement, que vous ne seriez
par tout ailleurs au même prix.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCIETY AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>Quant à la société, quoique infiniment agréable, je commence
ce chapitre par vous dire que j'éviterois de vous y inviter, si
vous étiez entièrement dés&oelig;uvré; les jours sont longs alors, et
laissent bien du vuide; mais homme de lettres, comme vous êtes,
je ne connois point de société qui vous convienne mieux. Nous
aurons autour de nous un cercle, comme il seroit impossible d'en
trouver ailleurs dans un aussi petit espace. Madame de Corcelles,
Mademoiselle Sulens, et M. de Montolieu, (Madame est morte,)
Messrs. Polier et leurs femmes, Madame de Severy, et M. et
Madame de Nassau, Mademoiselle de Chandieu, Madame de
St. Cierge, et M. avec leurs deux filles jolies et aimables,
Mesdames de Crousaz, Polier, de Charrières, &amp;c. font un fonds
de bonne compagnie dont on ne se lasse point, et dont M. de
Servan est si content qu'il regrette toujours d'être obligé de
retourner dans ses terres, et ne respire que pour s'établir tout
à fait à Lausanne. Il passa tout l'hyver de 1782 avec nous,
et il fut, on ne peut plus, agréable. Vous trouverez les m&oelig;urs
changées en bien, et plus conformes à nos ages, et à nos
caractères; peu de grandes assemblées, de grands repas, mais
beaucoup de petits soupers, de petites assemblées, où l'on fait
ce qu'on veut, où l'on cause, lit, &amp;c. et dont on écarte avec
soin les facheux de toute espèce. Il y a le Dimanche une société,
où tout ce qu'il y a d'un peu distingué en étrangères et étrangers,
est invité. Cela fait des assemblées de 40 à 50 personnes, où
l'on voit ce qu'on ne voit guères le reste de la semaine, et ces
espèces de <em>rout</em> font quelquefois plaisir. Nous sommes fort
dégoûtés des étrangers, surtout des jeunes gens, et nous les
écartons avec soin de nos petits comités, à moins qu'ils n'ayent
du mérite, ou quelques talens. A cet égard un de nos petits
travers, c'est l'engouement; mais vous en profiterez, mon cher
Monsieur, comme Edward Gibbon, et comme mon ami; vous
serez d'abord l'homme à la mode, et je vois d'ici que vous
soutiendrez fort bien ce rôle, sans vous en fâcher, dût on un peu
vous surfaire. <em>Je sens que tu me flattes, mais tu me fais plaisir</em>,
est peut-être le meilleur vers de Destouches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Voilà donc l'hyver; l'étude le matin, quelques conversations,
quand vous serez fatigué, avec quelque homme de lettres, ou
amateur, ou du moins qui aura vu quelque chose; à l'heure
qu'il vous plaira un dîner, point de fermier général, mais
l'honnête épicurien, avec un ou deux amis quand vous voudrez:
puis quelques visites, une soirée, souvent un souper. Quant
à l'été, vu votre manière d'aimer la campagne, on diroit que
ma remise a été faite pour vous; pendant que vous vous y
promènerez en sénateur, je serai souvent en bon paysan Suisse,
devant mon châlet, ou dans ma chaumière; puis nous nous
rencontrerons tout à coup, et tâcherons de nous remettre au
niveau l'un de l'autre. Nous fermerons nos portes à l'ordinaire,
excepté aux étrangers qui passent leur chemin; mais quand
nous voudrons, nous y aurons tous ceux que nous aimerons
à y voir; car on ne demande pas mieux que d'y venir se réjouir.
J'ai eu, un beau jour d'Avril ce printems, un déjeûner, qui m'a
coûté quelques Louis, où il y avoit plus de 40 personnes, je ne
sais combien de petites tables, une bonne musique au milieu du
verger, et une quantité de jeunes et jolies personnes dansant
des branles, et formant des chiffres en cadence; j'ai vu bien
des fêtes, j'en ai peu vu de plus jolies. Quand mon parc vous
ennuyera, nous aurons, ou nous louerons ensemble (et ce sera
ainsi un plaisir peu cher) un cabriolet léger, avec deux chevaux
gentils, et nous irons visiter nos amis dispersés dans les campagnes,
qui nous recevront à bras ouverts. Vous en serez content de nos
campagnes; toujours en proportion vous comprenez, et vous
trouverez en général un heureux changement pour les agrémens
de la société, et une sorte de recherche simple, mais élégante.
Les bergères du <i>Printems</i>, excepté Madame de Vanberg, ne sont
sans doute plus présentables, mais il y en a d'autres assez gentilles,
et quoiqu'elles ne soyent pas en bien grand nombre, il y en
aura toujours assez pour vous, mon cher Monsieur. Peu à peu
mon imagination m'a emporte, et mon style s'égaye, comme cela
nous arrivoit quelquefois dans nos châteaux en Espagne. Il est
bien tems de finir cet article, résumons nous plus sérieusement.</p>

<p>Si vous exécutez le plan que vous avez imaginé, j'aimerois
même à dire que vous embrassez, surtout d'après ce que vous
marquez vous même, <em>Si je ne consultois que mon c&oelig;ur et ma raison,
je romperois sur le champ cette indigne chaine</em>, &amp;c. Eh! que
voulez-vous consulter, si ce n'est votre c&oelig;ur et votre raison?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Si, dis-je, vous exécutez ce plan, vous retrouverez une liberté
et une indépendance, que vous n'auriez jamais dû perdre, et dont
vous méritez de jouir, une aisance qui ne vous coûtera qu'un
voyage de quelques jours, une tranquillité que vous ne pouvez
avoir à Londres, et enfin un ami qui n'a peut-être pas été un jour
sans penser à vous, et qui malgré ses défauts, ses foiblesses et
son infériorité, est encore un des compagnons qui vous convient
le mieux.</p>

<p>Il me reste à vous apprendre pourquoi je vous réponds si
tard: vous savez déjà actuellement que ce n'est pas manque
d'amitié et de zèle pour la chose; mais votre lettre m'a été
renvoyée de Lausanne ici, à Strasbourg, et je n'ai passé qu'une
poste sans y répondre, ce qui n'est pas trop, vous l'avouerez, pour
un pareil bavardage. Je suis parti de Lausanne la veille de
Pâques pour venir voir un M. Bourcard de Basle, fort de mes
amis; il est ici auprès du Comte de Cagliostro, pour profiter
de ses remèdes. Vous aurez entendu parler peut-être de cet
homme extraordinaire à tous égards. Comme j'ai été assez
malade tout l'hyver, je profite aussi de ses remèdes; mais comme
le tems du séjour du Comte ici n'est rien moins que sûr, le mieux
sera que vous m'écriviez <em>à M. D. chez M. Bourcard du Kirshgarten,
à Basle</em>.</p>

<p>Vous comprenez combien à tous égards, il est nécessaire
m'écrire sans perte de tems, dès que vous aurez pris une résolution.
Adieu, mon cher ami.*</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>462.</h2>

<h3><em>A M. Deyverdun.</em></h3>


<div class="sidenote">HIS GRATITUDE TO DEYVERDUN.</div>

<p>*Je reçois votre lettre du 10 Juin, le 21 de ce mois. Aujourd'hui
Mardi le 24, je mets la main à la plume (comme dit M. Fréron)
pour y répondre, quoique ma missive ne puisse partir par
arrangement des postes, que Vendredi prochain, 27 du courant.
O merveille de la grace efficace! Elle n'agit pas moins
puissamment sur vous, et moyennant le secours toujours prêt,
et toujours prompt de nos couriers, un mois nous suffit pour la
demande et la réponse. Je remercie mille fois le génie de
l'amitié, qui m'a poussé, après mille efforts inutiles, à vous écrire
enfin au moment le plus critique et le plus favorable. Jamais
démarche n'a répondu si parfaitement à tous mes v&oelig;ux et à<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
toutes mes espérances. Je comptois sans doute sur la durée et
la vérité de vos sentimens; mais j'ignorois (telle est la foiblesse
humaine) jusqu'à quel point ils avoient pu être attiédis par le
tems et l'éloignement; et je savois encore moins l'état actuel
de votre santé, de votre fortune et de vos liaisons, qui auroient
pu opposer tant d'obstacles à notre réunion.</p>

<p>Vous m'écrivez, vous m'aimez toujours; vous désirez avec zèle,
avec ardeur, de réaliser nos anciens projets; vous le pouvez, vous
le voulez; vous m'offrez dès l'automne votre maison, et quelle
terrasse! votre société, et quelle société! L'arrangement nous
convient à tous les deux; je retrouve à la fois le compagnon de
ma jeunesse, un sage conseiller, et un peintre qui fait représenter
et exagérer même les objets les plus rians. Ces exagérations me
font pour le moins autant de plaisir que la simple vérité. Si
votre portrait étoit tout à fait ressemblant, ces agrémens
n'existeroient que hors de nous mêmes, et j'aime encore mieux
les retrouver dans la vivacité de votre c&oelig;ur et de votre imagination.
Ce n'est pas que je ne reconnoisse un grand fond de vérité dans
le tableau de Lausanne; je connois le lieu de la scène, je me
transporte en idée sur <em>notre</em> terrasse, je vois ces côteaux, ce lac,
ces montagnes, ouvrage favoris de la nature, et je conçois sans
peine les embellissemens que votre goût s'est plu y ajouter. Je
me rappelle depuis vingt ou trente ans les m&oelig;urs, l'esprit,
l'aisance de la société, et je comprends que ce véritable ton de
la bonne compagnie se perpétue, et s'épure de père en fils, ou
plutôt de mère en fille; car il m'a toujours paru qu'à Lausanne,
aussi bien qu'en France, les femmes sont très supérieures aux
hommes. Dans un pareil séjour, je craindrois la dissipation bien
plus que l'ennui, et le tourbillon de Lausanne étonneroit un
philosophe accoutumé depuis tant d'années à la tranquillité de
Londres. Vous êtes trop instruit pour regarder ce propos,
comme une mauvaise plaisanterie; c'est dans les détroits qu'on
est entrainé par la rapidité des courans: il n'y en a point en
pleine mer. Dès qu'on ne recherche plus les plaisirs bruyans,
et qu'on s'affranchit volontiers des devoirs pénibles, la liberté
d'un simple particulier se fortifie par l'immensité de la ville.
Quant à moi, l'application à mon grand ouvrage, l'habitude, et
la récompense du travail, m'ont rendu plus studieux, plus
sédentaire, plus ami de la retraite. La Chambre des Communes
et les grands dîners exigent beaucoup de tems; et la tempérance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
d'un repas anglois vous permet de goûter de cinq ou six vins
différens, et vous ordonne de boire une bouteille de claret après
le dessert. Mais enfin je ne soupe jamais, je me couche de fort
bonne heure, je reçois peu de visites, les matinées sont longues,
les étés sont libres, et dès que je ferme ma porte, je suis oublié du
monde entier. Dans une société plus bornée et plus amicale, les
démarches sont publiques, les droits sont réciproques, l'on dîne de
bonne heure, on se goûte trop pour ne pas passer l'après-midi
ensemble; on soupe, on veille, et les plaisirs de la soirée ne
laissent pas de déranger le repos de la nuit, et le travail du
lendemain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS HESITATION TO ACCEPT.</div>

<p>Quel est cependant le résultat de ces plaintes? c'est seulement
que la mariée est trop belle, et que j'ose me servir de l'excuse
honnête de la santé et du privilège d'un homme de lettres;
il ne tiendra qu'à moi de modérer un peu l'excès de mes
jouissances. Pour cet engouement que vous m'annoncez, et qui
a toujours été le défaut des peuples les plus spirituels, je l'ai déjà
éprouvé sur un plus grand théâtre. Il y a six ans que l'ami de
Madame Necker fut reçu à Paris, comme celui de George Deyverdun
pourroit l'être à Lausanne. Je ne connois rien de plus
flatteur que cet accueil favorable d'un public poli et éclairé.
Mais cette faveur, si douce pour l'étranger, n'est-elle pas un peu
dangereuse pour l'habitant exposé à voir flétrir ses lauriers, par la
faute ou par l'inconstance de ses juges? Non; on se soutient
toujours, peut être pas précisément au même point d'élévation.
A l'abri de trois gros volumes in-quarto en langue étrangère,
encore ce qui n'est pas un petit avantage, je conserverai toujours
la réputation littéraire, et cette réputation donnera du relief aux
qualités sociales, si l'on trouve l'historien sans travers, sans
affectation et sans prétentions.</p>

<p>Je serai donc charmé et content de votre société, et j'aurois
pu dire en deux mots, ce qui j'ai bavardé en deux pages;
mais il y a tant de plaisir à bavarder avec un ami! car enfin
je possède à Lausanne un véritable ami; et les simples connoissances
remplaceront sans beaucoup de peine, tout ce qui
s'appelle liaison, et même amitié, dans ce vaste désert de
Londres. Mais au moment où j'écris, je vois de tous côtés une
foule d'objets dont la perte sera bien plus difficile à réparer.
Vous connoissiez ma bibliothèque; mais je suis en état de vous
rendre le propos de votre maison <em>c'est bien autre chose à cette</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
<em>heure</em>; formée peu à peu, mais avec beaucoup de soin et de
dépense, elle peut se nommer aujourd'hui un beau cabinet de
particulier. Non content de remplir à rangs redoublés la
meilleure pièce qui lui étoit destinée, elle s'est débordée dans
la chambre sur la rue, dans votre ancienne chambre à coucher,
dans la mienne, dans tous les recoins de la maison de <em>Bentinck-street</em>,
et jusques dans une chaumière que je me suis donnée à
<em>Hampton Court</em>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">J'ai mille courtisans rangés autour de moi:</div>
<div class="line">Ma retraite est mon Louvre, et j'y commande en roi.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Le fonds est de la meilleure compagnie Grecque, Latine,
Italienne, Françoise, et Angloise, et les auteurs les moins chers
à l'homme de goût, des ecclésiastiques, des Byzantins, des
Orientaux, sont les plus nécessaires à l'historien de la Décadence
et de la Chute, &amp;c. Vous ne sentez que trop bien le désagrément
de laisser, et l'impossibilité de transporter cinq ou six milles
volumes, d'autant plus que le ciel n'a pas voulu faire de la Suisse
un pays maritime. Cependant mon zèle pour la réussite de nos
projets communs, me fait imaginer que ces obstacles pourront
s'applanir, et que je puis adoucir ou supporter ces privations
douloureuses. Les bons auteurs classiques, la bibliothèque des
nations, se retrouvent dans tous les pays. Lausanne n'est pas
dépourvu de livres, ni de politesse, et j'ai dans l'esprit qu'on
pourroit acquérir pour un certain tems, quelque bibliothèque d'un
vieillard ou d'un mineur, dont la famille ne voudroit pas se
défaire entièrement. Quant aux outils de mon travail, nous
commencerons par examiner l'état de nos richesses; après quoi
il faudroit faire un petit calcul du prix, du poids et de la rareté
de chaque ouvrage, pour juger de ce qu'il seroit nécessaire de
transporter de Londres, et de ce qu'on acheteroit plus commodément
en Suisse; à l'égard de ces frais, on devroit les envisager
comme les avances d'une manufacture transplantée en pays
étranger, et dont on espère retirer dans la suite un profit
raisonnable. Malheureusement votre bibliothèque publique, en
y ajoutant même celle de M. de Bochat, est assez piteuse; mais
celles de Berne et de Basle sont très nombreuses, et je compterois
assez sur la bonhommie Helvétique, pour espérer que, moyennant
des recommendations et des cautions, il me seroit permis d'en
tirer les livres dont j'aurois essentiellement besoin. Vous êtes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
très bien placé pour prendre les informations, et pour faire les
démarches convenables; mais vous voyez du moins combien je
me retourne de tous les côtés, pour esquiver la difficulté la plus
formidable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS FRIEND AND VALET.</div>

<p>Venons à présent à des objets moins relevés, mais très
importans à l'existence et au bien-être de l'animal, le logement,
les domestiques, et la table. Pour mon appartement particulier,
une chambre à coucher, avec un grand cabinet et une antichambre,
auroient suffi à tous mes besoins; mais si vous pouvez vous en
passer, je me promenerai avec plaisir dans l'immensité de vos onze
pièces, qui s'accommoderont sans doute aux heures et aux saisons
différentes. L'article des domestiques renferme une assez forte
difficulté, sur laquelle je dois vous consulter. Vous connoissez,
et vous estimez Caplen mon valet de chambre, maître d'hotel, &amp;c.
qui a été nourri dans notre maison, et qui comptoit d'y finir ses
jours. Depuis votre départ, ses talens et ses vertus se sont
dévelloppés de plus en plus, et je le considère bien moins sur le
pied d'un domestique, que sur celui d'un ami. Malheureusement
il ne sait que l'Anglois, et jamais il n'apprendra de langue
étrangère. Il m'accompagna, il y a six ans, dans mon voyage
à Paris, mais il rapporta fidèlement à Londres toute l'ignorance,
et tous les préjugés d'un bon patriote. A Lausanne il me
coûteroit beaucoup, et à l'exception du service personnel, il ne
nous seroit que d'une très petite utilité. Cependant je supporterois
volontiers cette dépense, mais je suis très persuadé que, si son
attachement le portoit à me suivre, il s'ennuyeroit à mourir dans
un pays où tout lui seroit étranger et désagréable. Il faudroit
donc me détacher d'un homme dont je connois le zèle, la fidélité,
rompre tout d'un coup de petites habitudes qui sont liées avec le
bien-être journalier et momentané, et se résoudre à lui substituer
un visage nouveau, peut-être un mauvais sujet, toujours quelque
aventurier Suisse pris sur le pavé de Londres. Vous rappellez-vous
un certain George Suess qui a fait autrefois avec moi le
voyage de France et d'Italie? Je le crois marié et établi à
Lausanne; s'il vit encore, si vous pouvez l'engager à se rendre
ici, pour me ramener en Suisse, la compagnie d'un bon et ancien
serviteur ne laisseroit pas d'adoucir la chute, et il resteroit peut-être
auprès de moi, jusqu'à ce que nous eussions choisi un jeune
homme du pays, adroit, modeste et bien élevé, à qui je ferois un
parti avantageux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Les autres domestiques, gouvernantes, laquais, cuisinière, &amp;c.
se prennent et se renvoyent sans difficulté. Un article bien
plus important, c'est notre table, car enfin nous ne sommes pas
assez hermites, pour nous contenter des légumes et des fruits
de votre jardin, tout excellens qu'ils sont; mais je n'ai presque
rien à ajouter à l'honnêteté de vos propos, qui me donnent
beaucoup plus de plaisir que de surprise. Si je me trouvois sans
fortune, au lieu de rougir des bienfaits de l'amitié, j'accepterois
vos offres aussi simplement que vous les faites. Mais nous ne
sommes pas réduits à ce point, et vous comprenez assez qu'une
déconfiture angloise laisse encore une fortune fort décente au
Pays de Vaud, et pour vous dire quelque chose de plus précis,
je dépenserois sans peine et sans inconvénient cinq ou six cens
Louis. Vous connoissez le résultat aussi bien que les détails
d'un ménage; en supposant une petite table de deux philosophes
Epicuriens, quatre, cinq, ou six domestiques, des amis assez
souvent, des repas assez rarement, beaucoup de sensualité, et peu
de luxe, à combien estimez-vous en gros la dépense d'un mois et
d'une année? Le partage que vous avez déjà fait, me paroît des
plus raisonnables; vous me logez, et je vous nourris. A votre
calcul, j'ajouterois mon entretien personnel, habits, plaisirs, gages
de domestiques, &amp;c. et je verrois d'une manière assez nette,
l'ensemble de mon petit établissement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS HOPES OF A POLITICAL PLACE.</div>

<p>Après avoir essuyé tant de détails minutieux, le cher lecteur
s'imagine sans doute que la résolution de me fixer pendant quelque
tems aux bords du Lac Léman, est parfaitement décidée. Hélas!
rien n'est moins vrai; mais je me suis livré au charme délicieux
de contempler, de sonder, de palper ce bonheur, dont je sens tout
le prix, qui est à ma portée, et auquel j'aurai peut-être la bêtise
de renoncer. Vous avez raison de croire, mais vous ignorez
jusqu'à quel point vous l'avez, que ma carrière politique a été
plus semée d'épines que de roses. Eh! quel objet, quel motif,
pourroit me consoler de l'ennui des affaires, et de la honte de la
dépendance? <em>La gloire?</em> Comme homme de lettres, j'en jouis,
comme orateur je ne l'aurai jamais, et le nom des simples soldats
est oublié dans les victoires aussi bien que dans les défaites. <em>Le
devoir?</em> Dans ces combats à l'aveugle, où les chefs ne cherchent
que leur avantage particulier, il y a toujours à parier que les
subalternes feront plus de mal que de bien. <em>L'attachement
personnel?</em> Les ministres sont rarement dignes de l'inspirer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
jusqu'à présent Lord North n'a pas eu à se plaindre de moi, et si
je me retire du Parlement, il lui sera très aisé d'y substituer un
autre muet, tout aussi affidé que son ancien serviteur. Je suis
intimément convaincu, et par la raison, et par le sentiment, qu'il
n'y a point de parti, qui me convienne aussi bien que de vivre
avec vous, et auprès de vous à Lausanne; et si je parviens à la
place (<em>Commissioner of the Excise or Customs</em>) où je vise, il y aura
toutes les semaines cinq longues matinées, qui m'avertiront de la
folie de mon choix. Vous vous trompez à la vérité à l'égard
de l'instabilité de ces emplois; ils sont presque les seuls qui ne
ressentent jamais des révolutions du ministère.</p>

<p>Cependant si cette place s'offroit bientôt, je n'aurois pas le bon
sens et le courage de la refuser. Quels autres conseillers veux-je
prendre, sinon mon c&oelig;ur et ma raison? Il en est de puissans et
toujours écoutés: les égards, la mauvaise honte, tous mes amis, ou
soi-disant tels, s'écrieront que je suis un homme perdu, ruiné, un
fou qui se dérobe à ses protecteurs, un misanthrope qui s'exile au
bout du monde, et puis les exagérations sur tout ce qui seroit fait
en ma faveur, si surement, si promptement, si libéralement. Mylord
Sheffield opinera à me faire interdire et enfermer; mes deux
tantes et ma belle mère se plaindront que je les quitte pour
jamais, &amp;c. Et l'embarras de prendre mon bonnet de nuit,
comme disoit le sage Fontenelle, lorsqu'il n'etoit question que de
decoucher, combien de bonnets de nuit ne me faudra-t-il pas
prendre, et les prendre tout seul? car tout le monde, amis,
parens, domestiques, s'opposera à ma fuite. Voilà à la vérité des
obstacles assez peu redoutables, et en les décrivant, je sens qu'ils
s'affoiblissent dans mon esprit. Grace à ce long bavardage vous
connoissez mon intérieur, comme moi même, c'est à dire assez
mal; mais cette incertitude, très amicale pour moi, seroit très
facheuse pour vous. Votre réponse me parviendra vers la fin de
Juillet, et huit jours après, je vous promets une réplique nette
et décisive: <em>je pars</em> ou <em>je reste</em>. Si je pars, ce sera au milieu de
Septembre; je mangerai les raisins de votre treille les premiers
jours d'Octobre, et vous aurez encore le tems de me charger de
vos commissions. Ne me dites plus, <em>Monsieur, et très cher ami</em>;
le premier est froid, le second est superflu.*</p>

<h2>463.</h2>

<h3><em>M. Deyverdun à M. Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p>*Me voilà un peu embarrassé actuellement; je ne dois vous
appeller ni Monsieur, ni ami. Eh bien! vous saurez qu'étant
parti Samedi de Strasbourg, pendant que je venois ici, votre
seconde lettre alloit là, et qu'ainsi je reçus votre troisième,
Dimanche, et votre seconde, hier. La mention que vous y
faisiez du Suisse George, dont je n'ai pu rien trouver dans la
première, m'a fait comprendre qu'il y en avoit une seconde, et
j'ai cru devoir attendre un courier, la troisième n'exigeant pas de
réponse.</p>

<p>Pour votre parole, permettez que je vous en dispense encore,
et même jusqu'au dernier jour, je sens bien qu'un procédé
contraire vous conviendroit; mais certes il ne me convient pas du
tout. Ceci, comme vous le dites, est une espèce de mariage, et
pensez vous que malgré les engagemens les plus solemnels, je
n'eusse pas reconduit chez elle, du pied des autels, la femme la
plus aimable qui m'eut temoigné des regrets? Jamais je ne me
consolerois, si je vous voyois mécontent dans la suite, et dans
le cas de me faire des reproches. C'est à vous à faire, si vous
croyez nécessaire, des démarches de votre côté, qui fortifient
votre résolution; pour moi, je n'en ferai point d'essentielles,
jusqu'à ce que j'aye reçu encore une lettre de vous. Après ce
petit préambule, parlons toujours comme si l'affaire étoit décidée,
et repassons votre lettre. Tout ce que vous dites des grandes
et petites villes, est très vrai, et votre comparaison des détroits
et de la pleine mer, est on ne peut pas plus juste et agréable;
mais enfin, <em>comme on fait son lit, on se couche</em>, disoit Sancho
Pancha d'agréable mémoire, et qui peut mieux faire son lit à sa
guise qu'un étranger, qui, n'ayant ni devoirs d'état ni de sang
à remplir, peut vivre entièrement isolé, sans que personne y
puisse trouver à redire? Moi même, bourgeois et citoyen de
la ville, je suis presqu'entièrement libre. L'été, par exemple, je
déteste de m'enfermer le soir dans des chambres chaudes, pour
faire une partie. Eh bien! on m'a persécuté un peu la première
année; à présent on me laisse en repos. Il y aura sans doute
quelque changement dans votre manière de vivre: mais il me
semble qu'on se fait aisément à cela. Les dîners, surtout en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
femmes, sont très rares; les soupers peu grands; on reste plutôt
pour être ensemble, que pour manger, et plusieurs personnes ne
s'asseyent point. Je crois, tout compté et rabattu, que vouz
aurez encore plus de tems pour le cabinet qu'à Londres; on sort
peu le matin, et quand nos amis communs viendront chez moi,
et vous demanderont, je leur dirai; "ce n'est pas un oisif
comme vous autres, il travaille dans son cabinet," et ils se tairont
respectueusement.</p>

<p>Pour les bibliothèques publiques, votre idée ne pourroit, je
pense, se réaliser pour un lecteur ou même un écrivain ordinaire,
mais un homme qui joue un rôle dans la république des lettres, un
homme aimé et considéré, trouvera, je m'imagine, bien des
facilités; d'ailleurs, j'ai de bons amis à Berne, et je prendrai ici
des informations.</p>

<p>Passons à la table. Si j'étois à Lausanne, cet article seroit
plus sûr, je pourrois revoir mes papiers, consulter; j'ai une
chienne de mémoire. A vue de pays cela pourra aller de 20 à
30 Louis par mois, plus ou moins, vous sentez, suivant la friandise,
et le plus ou moins de convives. Marquez moi dans votre
première combien vous coûte le vôtre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCIAL HABITS AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>Je sens fort bien tous les bonnets de nuit: point de grands
changemens sans embarras, même sans regrets; vous en aurez
quelquefois sans doute: par exemple, si votre salle à manger,
votre salle de compagnie, sont plus riantes, vous perdrez pour le
vase de la bibliothèque. Pour ce qui est des représentations,
des discours au moins inutiles, il me semble que le mieux seroit
de masquer vos grandes opérations, de ne parler que d'une course,
d'une visite chez moi, de six mois ou plus ou moins. Vous
feriez bien, je pense, d'aller chez mon ami Louis Teissier; c'est
un brave et honnête homme, qui m'est attaché, qui aime notre
pays; il vous donnera tout plein de bons conseils avec zèle, et
vous gardera le secret.</p>

<p>Vous aurez quelquefois à votre table un poëte;&mdash;oui, Monsieur,
un poëte:&mdash;nous en avons un enfin. Procurez vous un volume
8vo. <em>Poësies Helvétiennes, imprimées l'année passée chez Mouser,
à Lausanne.</em><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Vouz trouverez entr'autres dans l'épitre au jardinier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
de la grotte, votre ami et votre parc. Toute la prose est de votre
très humble serviteur, qui désire qu'elle trouve grace devant
vous.</p>

<p>Le Comte de Cagliostro<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> a fait un séjour à Londres. On ne
sait qui il est, d'où il est, d'où il tire son argent; il exerce <em>gratis</em>
ses talens pour la médecine; il a fait des cures admirables;
mais c'est d'ailleurs le composé le plus étrange. J'ai cessé de
prendre ses remèdes qui m'échauffoient&mdash;l'homme d'ailleurs me
gâtoit le médecin. Je suis revenu à Basle avec mon ami.
Adieu; récrivez moi le plutôt possible.*</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>465.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
July 10th, 1783.
</p>

<p>*You will read the following lines with more patience and
attention than you would probably give to a hasty conference,
perpetually interrupted by the opening of the door, and perhaps
by the quickness of our own tempers. I neither expect nor desire
an answer on a subject of extreme importance to myself, but
which friendship alone can render interesting to you. We shall
soon meet at Sheffield.</p>

<p>It is needless to repeat the reflections which we have sometimes
debated together, and which I have often seriously weighed
in my silent solitary walks. Notwithstanding your active and
ardent spirit, you must allow that there is some perplexity in my
present situation, and that my future prospects are distant and
cloudy. I have lived too long in the world to entertain a very
sanguine idea of the friendship or zeal of Ministerial patrons;
and we are all sensible how much the powers of patronage are
reduced.*</p>

<p>The source of pensions is absolutely stopped, and a double
list of candidates is impatient and clamourous for half the
number of desirable places. A seat at the board of customs or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
excise was certainly the most practicable attempt, but how far are
we advanced in the pursuit? Could we obtain (it was indeed
unprecedented) an extraordinary commission? Have we received
any promise of the <em>first</em> vacancy? how often is the execution of
such a promise delayed to a second or third opportunity? When
will those vacancies happen? Incumbents are sometimes very
tough. Of the Excise I know less, but I am sure that the door
of the Customs (except when it was opened for Sir Stanier by a
pension of <em>equal</em> value) has been shut, at least during the last
three years. In the meanwhile I should be living in a state of
anxiety and dependence, working in the illiberal service of the
House of Commons, my seat in Parliament sinking in value every
day and my expenses very much exceeding my annual income.
*At the end of that time, or rather long before that time (for
their lives are not worth a year's purchase), our ministers are
kicked down stairs, and I am left their disinterested friend to
fight through another opposition, and to expect the fruits of
another revolution.</p>

<p>But I will take a more favourable supposition, and conceive
myself, in six months, firmly seated at the board of Customs;
before the end of the next six months, I should infallibly
hang myself. Instead of regretting my disappointment, I
rejoyce in my escape; as I am satisfied that no salary could
pay me for the irksomeness of attendance, and the drudgery
of business so repugnant to my taste, (and I will dare to say)
so unworthy of my character. Without looking forwards to
the possibility, still more remote, of exchanging that laborious
office for a smaller annuity, there is surely another plan, more
reasonable, more simple, and more pleasant; a temporary retreat
to a quiet and less expensive scene. In a four years' residence
at Lausanne, I should live within my income, save, and even
accumulate, my ready money; finish my history, an object of
profit as well as fame, expect the contingencies of elderly lives,
and return to England at the age of fifty, to form a lasting
independent establishment, without courting the smiles of a
minister, or apprehending the downfall of a party. Such have
been my serious sober reflections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLAN OF JOINING DEYVERDUN.</div>

<p>Yet I much question whether I should have found courage
to follow my reason and my inclination, if a friend had not
stretched his hand to draw me out of the dirt. The twentieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of last May I wrote to my friend Deyverdun, after a long interval
of silence, to expose my situation, and to consult in what
manner I might best arrange myself at Lausanne. From his
answer, which I received about a fortnight ago, I have the
pleasure to learn, that his heart and his house are both open
for my reception; that a family which he had lodged for some
years is about to leave him, and that at no other time my company
would have been so acceptable and convenient. I shall step, at
my arrival, into an excellent apartment and a delightful situation;
the fair division of our expences will render them very moderate,
and I shall pass my time with the companion of my youth, whose
temper and studies have always been congenial to my own. I
have given him my word of honour to be at Lausanne in the
beginning of October, and no power or persuasion can divert
me from this <small>IRREVOCABLE</small> resolution, which I am every day
proceeding to execute.</p>

<p>I wish, but I scarcely hope, to convince you of the propriety
of my scheme;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but at least you will allow, that when we are not
able to prevent the <em>follies</em> of our friends, we should strive to render
them as easy and harmless as possible. The arrangement of my
house, furniture and books will be left to meaner hands, but it is
to your zeal and judgment alone that I can trust the more
important disposal of Lenborough and Lymington. On these
subjects we may go into a Committee at Sheffield-place, but you
know it is the rule of a Committee not to hear any arguments
against the <em>principle</em> of the bill. At present I shall only observe,
that neither of these negociations ought to detain me here; the
former may be dispatched as well, the latter much better, in my
absence. <em>Vale.</em>*</p>

<h2>466.</h2>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Bentinck Street, July 26th, 1783.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>You have so long been acquainted with my indifference
or rather dislike to the house of Commons, that you will not be
much surprized, that I should entertain a thought or indeed a
resolution of vacating my seat. Your vain hope (a kind and a
friendly vanity) of my making a distinguished figure in that
assembly has long since been extinct, and you are now convinced
by repeated experience that my reputation must be derived solely
from my pen. A seat in parliament I can only value as it is
connected with some official situation of emolument: that connection
which has fortunately subsisted about three years is now
dissolved, and I do not see any probability of its being <em>speedily</em>
restored. Whatever may be the wishes or sentiments of my
political friends, their patronage has been extremely circumscribed
by the double list of candidates, the reduction of places and the
suppression of pensions. The most solid and attainable things
(at the boards of Customs or Excise) are incompatible with a
seat in parliament, and my prævious retreat (by taking from
them a motive of delay) will promote rather than obstruct the
accomplishment of my hopes and their promises. Thus restored
for some time to the enjoyment of freedom, I propose to spend
it in the society of my friend Deyverdun at Lausanne, who
presses me in the kindest manner to visit him in the house and
garden which he possesses in the most beautiful situation in the
World.</p>

<p>I intend going about the middle of September, and though
it is not possible to define precisely the time of my absence,
it is not likely that I shall pass less than a year in Switzerland.
I shall exchange the most unwholesome air (that of the
house of Commons) for the purest and most salubrious, the
heat and hurry of party for a cool litterary repose; and I have
little doubt that this excursion, which will amuse me by the
change of objects, will have a lasting and beneficial effect on my
health. The lease of my house expires next Christmas, and I
shall take the opportunity of disengaging myself from an useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
expence, and of removing to a hired room my books, and such
part of my furniture as may be worth keeping. You will be
pleased to hear that the faithful Caplen accompanies me abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS DEPARTURE A NECESSITY.</div>

<p>Such is the light in which my journey should be represented
to those friends to whom it may be advisable to say any thing of
my motives. Every circumstance which I have already stated is
strictly true, but you will too easily conceive that it is not the
<em>whole truth</em>: that this step is dictated by the hard law of æconomy
or rather of necessity, and that the moment of my return will
not entirely depend on my own choice. You have not forgot
how a similar intention some years ago was superseded by my
appointment to the board of trade. Perhaps it would have been
wiser if I had left England immediately after the loss of my
place, and the sense of this imprudent delay urges me more
strongly every day to avoid the difficulties of a still longer procrastination.
By this resolution I shall deliver myself at once
from the heavy expence of a London life, my friend Deyverdun
and myself shall join in a moderate though elegant establishment
at Lausanne; and I can wait without inconvenience for one of
the events, which may enable me to revisit with pleasure and
credit my country, and the person, whom in that country, I most
value, I mean yourself. Allow me to add (though I know such
thoughts will be absorbed in your mind by higher and more
tender sentiments), yet allow me to add that at the stated days of
Midsummer and Christmas, you may regularly draw for your
half year's annuity on Messieurs Gosling in Fleet Street, and that
effectual steps shall be taken to secure you from a possibility
of disappointment. It would not be my absence, but my stay
in England that could create any delay or difficulty on that
subject.</p>

<p>And now, my dear madam, let me submit to your consideration
and final decision, a question which for my own part I am unable
to determine, whether I shall visit Bath before I leave England.
If I consulted only my wishes, the mere expence and trouble of
the journey would be obstacles of small account, but I much fear,
that on this occasion, prudence will dissuade what inclination
would prompt, and that a meeting of three or four days (for it
could be no more) would tend rather to embitter than to alleviate
our unavoidable separation. If you decide for my coming down,
it will probably take place between the 20th and 30th of next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
month, and I must beg that little, or nothing, may be said on the
subject of my approaching journey, and that we may (silently)

Sheffield-place, August 8th, 1783.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS REASONS FOR LEAVING LONDON.</div>

<p>Your truly <em>maternal</em> letters (which I have repeatedly
perused) have agitated my mind with a variety of pleasing and
painful sensations. I am grieved that you should contemplate my
departure in so melancholy a light, but I shall always revere the
affection which prompts your anxiety, and magnifies the evil. I
receive with more gratitude than surprise your generous offer of
devoting yourself and so large a portion of your income to my
relief, and I am concerned to find on calmer reflection that such
a project is attended with insuperable difficulties. After the
mutual and unpleasant sacrifice of our habits and inclinations, I
could not, even with your assistance, reduce the expence of a
London life to the level of my present income, and the two
hundred a year which you so nobly propose would be exhausted
by the single article of a Coach.</p>

<p>With regard to the delays which you suggest, you may be
assured that I shall take no material step without consideration
and advice. Had I staid in London, I should have removed from
Bentinck Street. On my return another house may at any time
be procured, and I shall carefully preserve the most valuable part
of my furniture, plate, linnen, china, beds, &amp;c. My seat in
Parliament cannot be vacated till the next Session, and I shall
leave the disposal of it to our friend Lord Sheffield, in whose
zeal and discretion we may safely confide. On his own account
he regrets my departure, but he has been forced to give a full
though reluctant approbation to my design. I wish it were in
my power to remove all your kind apprehensions which relate to
the length of my absence and the choice of my residence. I
certainly do not entertain a very sanguine idea of political friendship,
but I am convinced that such persons as really wish to serve
me will not be discouraged by my temporary retreat to Switzerland.
In the leisure and quiet which I shall enjoy at Lausanne,
I shall prosecute the continuation of my history, and the care of
publishing a work, from whence I may expect both honour and
advantage, will secure, within a reasonable space, my return to
England. Your idea of the climate of Switzerland is by many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
degrees too formidable; the air though sometimes keen, is pure
and wholesome, the Gout is much less frequent on the Continent
than in our Island, and the provoking luxury of London dinners
is much more likely to feed that distemper, than the temperance
and tranquillety of Lausanne. In the society of my friend
Deyverdun, I hope to spend some time with comfort and propriety,
but my affections are still fixed in England, and it will be
my wish and endeavour to shorten the term of this necessary
separation, and in the meanwhile you may depend on the most
regular communication of every circumstance that affects my
health and happiness.</p>

<p class="signature">
I am, my Dear Madam,<br />

<p>I have some questions to ask you about the disposal of certain

not mix those trifles with the more serious purpose of this letter.</p>

more deeply than the kind concern of Lady S[heffield], and
the silent grief of Mrs. Porten. Yet the age of my friends makes a
very essential difference. I can scarcely hope ever to see my aunt

will make me a visit, and that in less than four, I shall return it
with a chearful heart at Sheffield-place. Business advances; this
morning my books were shipped for Rouen, and will reach Lausanne
almost as soon as myself. On Thursday morning the bulk of the
library moves from Bentinck-street to Downing-street. I shall
escape from the noise to Hampton Court, and spend three or four
days in taking leave. I want to know your precise motions, what
day you arrive in town, whether you visit Lord Beauchamp before
the races, &amp;c. I am now impatient to be gone, and shall only
wait for a last interview with you. Your medley of Judges,
Advocates, politicians, &amp;c., is rather <em>useful</em> than pleasant. Town

<p>*I am astonished with your apparition and flight, and am at a
loss to conjecture the mighty and sudden business of *Coventry,*
which could not be delayed till next week. <em>Timeo</em> *Conways,* their
selfish cunning, and your sanguine unsuspecting spirit. Not
dreaming of your arrival, I thought it unnecessary to apprize you,
that I delayed Hampton to this day; on Monday I shall return,
and will expect you Tuesday evening, either in Bentinck or
Downing-street, as you like best. Yon have seen the piles of
learning accumulated in your parlour; the transportation will be
atchieved to-day, and Bentinck Street is already reduced to a
light, ignorant habitation, which I shall inhabit till about the
1st of September; four days must be allowed for clearing
and packing; these I shall spend in Downing-street, and after
seeing you a moment on your return, I shall start about Saturday
the 6th. London is a desert, and life, without books, business,
or society, will be somewhat tedious. From this state, you will
judge that your plan coincides very well, only I think you should
give me the whole of Wednesday in Bentinck-street. With regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to Bushy, perhaps as a compliment to Lord L. you had better
defer it till your return.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>*</p>

<p>You have not forgot the model of a letter for Sainsbury,
Way, Hearne, &amp;c., with the 200 Guineas reward for the proper
sale of Lenborough. I return your three letters with a fourth
not less curious, which I have not yet answered. Mrs. G.'s
pride is not inferior to her tenderness. *I admire Gregory Way,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
and should envy him, if I did not possess a disposition somewhat
similar to his own. My lady will be reposed and restored at

<p>I can easily attribute your silence to the true motive,
the difficulty (of which I am likewise conscious) of our present
situation. The subject which occupies our minds has been
reciprocally exhausted: it is unpleasant to resume a melancholy
train of ideas, and it is impossible to write with ease and
chearfullness on indifferent subjects. Yet I almost flatter myself
that if you are not satisfied with my reasons, you are at least
disposed to acquiesce in a resolution which is the offspring of
necessity, and will I trust be the parent of happiness. I repeat
my promise that distance shall only render me a more punctual
correspondent, and I must again intreat that you would turn
your thoughts from the moment of our separation to that of
our reunion.</p>

<p>After sending two boxes of books to Lausanne I have
deposited the remainder of my library in Lord Sheffield's
capacious mansion in Downing Street, whither I shall send
next week my plate, linnen, beds, &amp;c. I expect your commands

<div class="sidenote">FAREWELL TO SHEFFIELD PLACE.</div>

<p>*For the names of Sheffelina, &amp;c. are too playful for the
serious temper of my mind. In the whole period of my life I
do not recollect a day in which I felt more unpleasant sensations,
than that on which I took my leave of Sheffield-place. I forgot
my friend Deyverdun, and the fair prospect of quiet and
happiness which awaits me at Lausanne. I lost sight of our
almost certain meeting at the end of a term, which, at our
age, cannot appear very distant; nor could I amuse my uneasiness
with the hopes, the more doubtful prospect, of your visit to
Switzerland. The agitation of preparing every thing for my
departure has, in some degree, diverted these melancholy thoughts;
yet I still look forwards to the decisive day (to-morrow Se'nnight)
with an anxiety of which yourself and Lord S. have the principal
share.</p>

death of Sir John Russell,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> which so strongly reminded us of the

is arrived, but two Flanders mails are due. Æolus does not seem
to approve of my designs, and there is little merit in waiting till
Friday. I should wait with more reluctance, did I think there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

After many adverse reflections, I have finally
resolved to begin my journey on Monday; a heavy journey, with
much apprehension, and much regret. Yet I consider, 1st, That

That, supposing the very worst, even that worst would not
overthrow my general plan of living abroad, though it would
derange my hopes of a quiet and delightful establishment with
my friend.* Upon the whole, without giving way to melancholy
fears, my reason conjectures that his indolence thought it
superfluous to write any more, that it was my business to act
and move, and his duty to sit still and receive me with open
arms. At least he is well informed of my operations, as I
wrote to him (since his last) July 31st, from Sheffield-place;
August 19th; and this week, September 9th. The two first
have already reached him.</p>

<p>As I shall not arrive at, or depart from, Dover till Tuesday

to catch the Monday's post. Let us improve these last short

are ordered, and I shall start about eleven o'clock. I had not
the least symptom of sea sickness, while my companions were
spewing round me. Laurens has read the pamphlet,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and thinks
it has done much mischief&mdash;a good sign! Adieu, the Captain is
impatient. I shall reach Lausanne by the end of next week, but
may probably write on the road.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS JOURNEY THROUGH FRANCE.</div>

<p>*Let the Geographical Maria place before you the map of
France, and trace my progress as far as this place, through the
following towns: Boulogne, (where I was forced to land,) St.
Omer, (where I recovered my road,) Aire, Bethune, Douay,
Cambray, St. Quentin, La Fère, Laon, Rheims, Chalons, St.
Dizier, and Langres, where I have just finished my supper. The
Inns, in general, more agreable to the palate, than to the sight or
smell. But, with some short exceptions of time and place, I have
enjoyed good weather and good roads, and at the end of the ninth
day, I feel so little fatigued, that the journey appears no more
than a pleasant airing. I have generally conversed with Homer
and Lord Clarendon, often with Caplin and Muff;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> sometimes
with the French postillions&mdash;of the above-mentioned animals the
least rational. To-morrow I lye at Besançon, and, according to
the arrangement of post or hired horses, shall either sup at
Lausanne on Friday, or dine there Saturday. I feel some suspense
and uneasiness with regard to Deyverdun; but in the scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
both of reason and constitution, my hopes preponderate very
much above my fears. From Lausanne I will immediately write.
I embrace my lady. If Aunt Kitty's gratitude and good breeding
have not driven her away upon the first whisper of Brighton, she
will share this intelligence; if she is gone, a line from you would
be humane and attentive. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur, les Chevaux seront prêts

six feet high from the ground.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, September 30th, 1783.
</p>

<p>*I arrived safe in harbour last Saturday, the 27th instant, about
ten o'Clock in the morning; but as the post only goes out twice
a week, it was not in my power to write before this day. Except
one day, between Langres and Besançon, which was laborious
enough, I finished my easy and gentle airing without any fatigue,
either of mind or body. I found Deyverdun well and happy, but
much more happy at the sight of a friend, and the accomplishment
of a scheme which he had so long and impatiently desired. His
garden, terrace, and <em>park</em>, have even exceeded the most sanguine
of my expectations and remembrances; and you yourself cannot
have forgotten the charming prospect of the Lake, the mountains,
and the declivity of the Pays de Vaud. But as human life is
perpetually checquered with good and evil, I have found some
disappointments on my arrival. The easy nature of Deyverdun,
his indolence, and his impatience, had prompted him to reckon
too positively that his house would be vacant at Michaelmas;
some unforeseen difficulties have arisen, or have been discovered
when it was already too late, and the consummation of our hopes
is (I am much afraid) postponed to next spring. At first I was
knocked down by the unexpected thunderbolt, but I have gradually
been reconciled to my fate, and have granted a free and
gracious pardon to my friend. As his own apartment, which
afforded me a temporary shelter, is much too narrow for a settled
residence, we hired for the winter a convenient ready furnished
apartment in the nearest part of the Rue de Bourg, whose back
door leads in three steps to the terrace and garden, as often as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
tolerable day shall tempt us to enjoy their beauties; and this
arrangement has even its advantage, of giving us time to deliberate
and provide, before we enter on a larger and more regular
establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ABBÉ RAYNAL.</div>

<p>But this is not the sum of my misfortunes; hear, and pity!
The day after my arrival (Sunday) we had just finished a very
temperate dinner, and intended to begin a round of visits on
foot, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau sous le bras</i>, when, most unfortunately, Deyverdun
proposed to show me something in the Court; we boldly
and successfully ascended a flight of stone steps, but in the
descent I missed my footing, and strained, or sprained, my ancle
in a painful manner. My old latent Enemy, (I do not mean the
Devil,) who is always on the watch, has made an ungenerous use
of his advantage, and I much fear that my arrival at Lausanne
will be marked with a fit of the Gout, though it is quite unnecessary
that the intelligence or suspicion should find its way to
Bath. Yesterday afternoon I lay, or at least sat, in state to
receive visits, and at the same moment my room was filled with
four different nations. The loudest of these nations was the
single voice of the Abbé Raynal,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> who, like your friend, has chosen
this place for the azylum of freedom and history. His conversation,
which might be very agreable, is intolerably loud, peremptory,
and insolent; and you would imagine that he alone was the
Monarch and legislator of the World.</p>

<p>Adieu. I embrace My lady, and the infants.* Inform
Maria that my accident has prevented me from looking out
for a proper spot for my interment. *With regard to the important
transactions for which you are constituted Plenipotentiary,
I expect with some impatience, but with perfect confidence,
the result of your labours. You may remember what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
mentioned of my conversation with Charles Fox about the
place of Minister at Bern: I have talked it over with Deyverdun,
who does not dislike the idea, provided this place was allowed
to be my Villa, during at least two-thirds of the Year; but
for my part, I am sure that* a thousand guineas *is worth more
than Ministerial friendship and gratitude; so I am inclined to
think, that they are preferable to an office which would be
procured with difficulty, enjoyed with constraint and expence,
and lost, perhaps, next April, in the annual Revolutions of our
domestic Government. Again Adieu.*</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, September 30th, 1783.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>As I know you prefer a speedy to a long letter, I write
by the first post to inform you that after an easy and pleasant
journey of thirteen days, I arrived here on Saturday the 27th
instant in perfect health both of mind and body. You will not
expect that I should inform you how far my expectations are
answered in any or in every respect. The very novelty and
beauty of the scene would give a pleasing colour to every object,
and the satisfaction of meeting and conversing with an old friend
like Deyverdun is alone worth a journey of six hundred miles.
He has not forgot his obligations to you, and begs me in his name
to say everything that is kind and grateful. We have been so
compleatly taken up and satisfied with each other that as yet I
have scarcely stirred from home, and as this is the season of the
vintage the town is remarkably empty. But the weather is good,
and our terrace now affords such a prospect of the lake and
mountains, as cannot perhaps be equalled in the World. I most
sincerely wish that you were walking there, and you would soon
forget the more humble beauties of your Belvidere. But I must
content myself with the hope, and not a distant hope, of seeing
you again on the hills, not of Switzerland but of Bath.</p>

<p class="signature">
I am, Dear Madam,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>That we may never resume the indelicate subject, I shall
say once for all that every Christmas and Midsummer Day, without
expecting any draught from me, you need only send your
commands to Messrs. Gosling, Bankers in Fleet Street, as thus,
Pay to Mr. &mdash;&mdash; the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds, and
place to the account of E. G., Esq., for D. G. They are properly

<h3><em>To Lady Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, October 28th, 1783.
</p>

<p>*The progress of my Gout is in general so regular, and there
is so much uniformity in the history of its decline and fall, that
I have hitherto indulged my laziness, without much shame or
remorse, without supposing that you would be very anxious for
my safety, which has been sufficiently provided for by the triple
care of my friend Deyverdun, my humbler friend Caplin, and
a very conversable Physician (not the famous Tissot<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>), whose
ordinary fee is ten Batz, about fifteen pence English. After the
usual encrease and decrease of my member (for it has been confined
to the injured foot), the Gout has retired in good order,
and the remains of weakness, which obliged me to move on the
rugged pavement of Lausanne with a stick, or rather small crutch,
are to be ascribed to the sprain, which might have been a much
more serious business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHARMS OF LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>As I have now spent a month at Lausanne, you will
inquire with much curiosity, more kindness, and some mixture
of spite and malignity, how far the place has answered my
expectations, and whether I do not repent of a resolution
which has appeared so rash and ridiculous to my ambitious
friends? To this question, however natural and reasonable,
I shall not return an immediate answer, for two reasons:
1. <em>I have not yet made a fair tryal.</em> The disappointment and
delay with regard to Deyverdun's house, will confine us this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
winter to lodgings, rather convenient than spacious or pleasant.
I am only beginning to recover my strength and liberty, and to
look about on persons and things; the greatest part of those
persons are in the Country taken up with their Vintage: my
books are not yet arrived, and, in short, I cannot look upon
myself as settled in that comfortable way which you and I understand
and relish. Yet the weather has been heavenly, and till
this time, the end of October, we enjoy the brightness of the sun,
and somewhat gently complain of its immoderate heat. 2. If I
should be too sanguine in expressing my satisfaction in what
I have done, you would ascribe that satisfaction to the novelty
of the scene, and the inconstancy of man; and I deem it far
more safe and prudent to postpone any positive declaration, till
I am placed by experience beyond the danger of repentance and
recantation.</p>

<p>Yet of one thing I am sure, that I possess in this Country,
as well as in England, the best cordial of life, a sincere,
tender, and sensible friend, adorned with the most valuable and
pleasant qualities both of the heart and head. The inferior
enjoyments of leisure and society are likewise in my power; and
in the short excursions which I have hitherto made, I have commenced
or renewed my acquaintance with a certain number of
persons, more especially women, (who, at least in France and this
country, are undoubtedly superior to our prouder sex,) of rational
minds and elegant manners. I breakfast alone, and have declared
that I receive no visits in the morning, which you will easily
suppose is devoted to study. I find it impossible, without inconvenience,
to defer my dinner beyond two o'Clock. We have got
a very good Woman Cook. Deyverdun, who is somewhat of an
Epicurean Philosopher, understands the management of a table,
and we frequently invite a guest or two to share our luxurious,
but not extravagant repasts. The afternoons are (and will be
much more so hereafter) devoted to society, and I shall find it
necessary to play at cards much oftener than in London: but
I do not dislike that way of passing a couple of hours, and I
shall not be ruined at Shilling whist. As yet I have not supped,
but in the Course of the winter I must sometimes sacrifice an
evening abroad, and in exchange I hope sometimes to steal a day
at home, without going into Company.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">A <em>PENSION</em> FOR MISS HOLROYD.</div>

<p>As every idea which relates to you and yours is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
uppermost in my mind, I have not forgot our schemes to finish
in this School of freedom and equality the education of the
future Baroness of Roscommon,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and Deyverdun agrees with
me in thinking that a couple of years spent at Lausanne would
be of infinite service to her. But as I am convinced that she
has attained the age in which it would be the most beneficial
and the least dangerous, I would recommend speedy and
decisive measures. If you could be satisfied with an ordinary
plan (I hate the name and idea of a boarding school) Maria
might be entrusted to a Madame Ostervald (Lord S. knew
and liked her under the name of Mademoiselle Bourgeois),
who educates with reputation and success several young ladies
of fashion. But as your daughter deserves a special and superior
guide, we have cast our eyes (without knowing whether she would
accept it) on a lady, who, by her birth, station, connections,
understanding, knowledge, and temper, appears, in the judgment
of Deyverdun, her particular friend, to be not unworthy to supply
your place. She lives next door to us, and <em>our</em> eyes and ears
(two pair) would be continually open. If you found an opportunity
of sending Maria in the spring with any proper travellers,
We would meet her at Geneva, Lyons, &amp;c. With such a hostage,
I should be sure of seeing Lord S. and yourself, and a year's trial
would determine you to leave or remove her. If you listen
seriously to this idea, I will send you more particular accounts,
and take every proper step. If you cannot resolve, accept this
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bavardage</i> as a proof of love and solicitude.</p>

<p>*I have all this time been talking to Lord S.; I hope that
he has dispatched my affairs, and it would give me pleasure to
hear that I am no longer member for Lymington, nor Lord of
<em>Lenborough</em>. Adieu. I feel every day that the distance serves
only to make me think with more tenderness of the persons
whom I love.*</p>

<p>On reading what I have written, I must laugh at my sudden
and peremptory recommendations about Maria, yet I coolly think
it the best scheme. You oblige me beyond expression by your
kindness to Aunt Kitty. N.B. I always desire double letters.&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
find I shall have some commissions for you (Sheffelina), but I
do not suppose you in town till after Christmas.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>486.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, November 14th, 1783.
</p>

<p>*Last Tuesday, November 11th, after plaguing and vexing
yourself all the morning about some business of your fertile
creation, you went to the House of Commons, and passed the
afternoon, the evening, and perhaps the night, without sleep or
food, stifled in a close room by the heated respiration of six
hundred politicians, inflamed by party and passion, and tired of
the repetition of dull nonsense, which, in that illustrious assembly,
so far outweighs the proportion of reason and eloquence. On the
same day, after a studious morning, a friendly dinner, and a
chearful assembly of both sexes, I retired to rest at eleven o'Clock,
satisfied with the past day, and certain that the next would afford
me the return of the same quiet and rational enjoyments. <em>Which
has the better bargain?</em></p>

<p>Seriously, I am every hour more grateful to my own judgment
and resolution, and only regret that I so long delayed
the execution of a favourite plan, which I am convinced is the
best adapted to my character and inclinations. Your conjecture
of the revolutions of my face, when I heard that the
house was for this winter inaccessible, is probable, but false.
I bore my disappointment with the temper of a Sage, and only
use it to render the prospect of next year still more pleasing to
my imagination. You are likewise mistaken, in imputing my
fall to the awkwardness of my limbs. The same accident might
have happened to Slingsby himself, or to any <em>Hero</em> of the age,
the most distinguished for his <em>bodily activity</em>. I have now
resumed my entire strength, and walk with caution, yet with
speed and safety, through the streets of this mountainous city.
After a month of the finest autumn I ever saw, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bise</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> made me
feel my old acquaintance; the weather is now milder, and this
present day is dark and rainy, not much better than what you
probably enjoy in England. The town is comparatively empty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
but the Noblesse are returning every day from their Chateaux,
and I already perceive that I shall have more reason to complain
of dissipation than of dulness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD ACQUAINTANCES AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>As I told Lady S., I am afraid of being too rash and
hasty in expressing my satisfaction; but I must again repeat,
that appearances are extremely favourable. I am sensible that
general praise conveys no distinct ideas, but it is very difficult
to enter into particulars where the individuals are unknown,
or indifferent to our correspondent. You have forgotten the
<em>old</em> Generation, and in twenty years a new one is grown up.
Death has swept many from the World, and chance or choice
has brought many to this place. If you enquire after your
old acquaintance Catherine Crousaz, you must be told, that
she is solitary, uggly, blind, and universally forgotten. Your
later flame, and our common Goddess, the Eliza,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> passed a month
at the Inn. The greatest part of the time either in fit or taking
the air on horseback. She came to consult Tissot, and was
acquainted with Cerjat, but she appears to have made no conquests,
and no fountain has been dedicated to her memory.*</p>

<p>And now to business. By this time those who would give
me nothing else have nobly rewarded my merit with the Chiltern
Hundreds. I retire without a sigh from the Senate, and am only
impatient to hear that you have received the sum, which your
<em>modesty</em> was content to take for my seat. Sir Andrew<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is an
honourable man, yet I am satisfied that you have not neglected
any of the necessary precautions. It will be advisable to have
the odd hundred in Gosling's shop and to pay the thousand to
Messrs. Darrel, Winchester Street, who will vest it for me in the
three per cent. We must take advantage of this stupendous fall
of the Stocks, which amazes and frightens many poor souls here
who apprehend that poor old England is on the brink of ruin.
But this same circumstance is equally hostile to the sale of
Lenborough, and though £200 or 300 a year and some part of my
tranquillity depend on being released from the claws of my
Mortgagee, yet I am much afraid that in the present state of
things an <em>equal</em> purchaser will not easily be found. But your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
native vigour excited by friendship will remove mountains and
perform impossibilities. My salvation would be more assured if
I had half as much faith in any body else.</p>

<p>*With regard to meaner cares, these are two, which you can
and will undertake. 1. As I have not renounced my Country,
I should be glad to hear of your Parliamentary squabbles, which
may be done with small trouble and expence. After an interesting
debate, Miss Firth or My lady in due time may cut the speeches
from Woodfall. You will write or dictate any curious anecdote,
and the whole, inclosed in a letter, may be dispatched to Lausanne.
2. A set of Wedgewood China, which we talked of in London,
and which would be most acceptable here. As you have a <em>sort</em> of
a taste, I leave to your own choice the colour and the pattern;
but as I have the inclination and means to live very handsomely
<em>here</em>, I desire that the size and number of things may be adequate
to a plentiful table.</p>

<p>If you see Lord North, assure him of my gratitude; had
he been a more successful friend, I should now be drudging at
the board of Customs, or vexed with business in the amiable
society of *the Duke of M[anchester].* To Lord Loughborough
present a more affectionate sentiment; I am satisfied with his
intention to serve me, if I had not been in such a fidget. I am
sure you will not fail, while you are in town, to visit and comfort
poor Aunt Kitty. I wrote to her on my first arrival, and she
may be assured that I will not neglect her.* Any occasional hints
from Bath will be wellcome, but nothing from hence must ever
transpire. *To My lady I say nothing; we have now our private
Correspondence, into which the eye of an husband should not be
permitted to intrude. I am really satisfied with the success of
the Pamphlet;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> not only because I have a sneaking kindness for
the author, but as it shows me that plain sense, full information,
and warm spirit, are still acceptable to the World. You talk of
Lausanne as a place of retirement; yet from the situation and
freedom of the Pays de Vaud, all nations, and all extraordinary
characters, are astonished to meet each other. The Abbé Raynal,
the grand Gibbon, and Mercier,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> author of the Tableau de Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
have been in the same room. The other day, the Prince and
Princess de Ligne,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the Duke and Dutchess d'Ursel, &amp;c. came
from Brussels on purpose (literally true) to act a comedy at
d'Hermanches's, in the Country. He was dying, and could not
appear; but we had Comedy, ball, and supper. The event seems
to have revived him; for that great man is fallen from his
ancient glory, and his nearest relations refuse to see him. I told
you of poor Catherine's deplorable state; but Madame de Mesery,
at the age of sixty-nine, is still handsome. Adieu.*</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>487.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, December 20th, 1783.
</p>

<p>*I have received both your Epistles; and as any excuse will
serve a man who is at the same time very busy and very idle,
I patiently expected the second, before I entertained any thoughts
of answering the first.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">SALE OF LENBOROUGH.</div>

<p>And so poor Lenborough is at length sold; poor indeed I may
call, for I must confess that I am most woefully disappointed in
the price. Without going back to the Golden Age in which we
looked down with disdain on the round twenty, you may remember
that even this summer we scarcely allowed our most
timid expectations to sink below seventeen, and this sum for
which it is now sold falls £1400 short of that amount, without
deducting the promised gratuity to Christie.</p>

<p>You might indeed reckon on my impatience to be delivered
from a heavy burden both of fortune and of mind which I have
often deplored with so much energy, but that burthen was much
alleviated by my <em>rational</em> retreat from a scene of tumult and
expence, and I always understood that we should take the chance
of the winter and of the rise of stocks before we tryed the
decisive and almost irrevocable measure of an auction. However
the blow is struck, and I have already reconciled my mind to this
new loss. I should have been afraid of writing thus much to
Hugonin, but your nerves are more firmly strung, and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
these expressions of disappointment, you discern, that instead of
being displeased with your conduct, however inadequate to my
hopes, I feel myself inexpressibly obliged to your pure fervent and
persevering friendship. You will watch over the conclusion of
this business, and whatever steps on my side may be necessary
shall be diligently executed as soon as you send me the proper
papers and instruction. When the money is paid (in February)
you will leave the residue, a wretched fragment, in the hands
of the Goslings on my account. I have not absolutely determined
how I shall employ it. Something must be done in the way
of annuity, and the French funds which are very fashionable in
this country are wonderfully tempting to a poor man by the
high interest, but I am aware of their slippery foundation, and
you may be assured that I shall do nothing of that kind without
full and mature and even cautious investigation. For the same
reason, instead of paying the money to Darrel, I could wish that
the £1100 or £1000 for Lymington (for we must not haggle
about trifles) may likewise slumber for a little while in the shop
in Fleet Street. Yet I should not be sorry to hear that the
direction comes too late and that they are already more actively
employed.</p>

<p>Sure I have been particularly unfortunate in my connections
of business, for in good truth, Winton, Lovegrove, and Sir H.
Burrard<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> are more than should fall to the share of one man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRIDE IN FOX'S FAME.</div>

<p>Yet the last mentioned beast is no fool, and when that
affectionate kinsman has squeezed the Minister to the utmost,
he will be satisfied with <em>all</em> that he can get, and will not suffer
his farm to lye fallow without being of any value either to
landlord or tenant. *I therefore conclude, on every principle
of common sense, that, before this moment, his own interest and
that of the Government, stimulated by your active zeal, have
already expelled me from the House, to which, without regret,
I bid an everlasting farewell. The agreeable hour of five o'Clock
in the morning, at which you commonly retire, does not tend
to revive my attachment; but if you add the soft hours of
your morning committee,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> in the discussion of taxes, customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
frauds, smugglers, &amp;c., I think I should beg to be released
and quietly sent to the Gallies, as a place of leisure and freedom.
Yet I do not depart from my general principles of toleration;
some animals are made to live in the water, others on the Earth,
many in the air, and some, as it is now believed, even in fire.
Your present hurry of Parliament I perfectly understand; when
opposition make the attack&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent12">&mdash;&mdash;Horæ</div>
<div class="line">Momento cita mors venit, aut victoria læta.</div>
</div></div>

<p>But when the Minister brings forward strong and decisive
measure, he at length prevails; but his progress is retarded
at every step, and in every stage of the bill, by a pertinacious,
though unsuccessful, minority. I am not sorry to
hear of the splendour of Fox; I am proud, in a foreign
Country, of his fame and abilities, and our little animosities are
extinguished by my retreat from the English Stage. With
regard to the substance of the business, I scarcely know what
to think: the vices of the Company,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> both in their persons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
their constitution, were manifold and manifest; the danger was
imminent, and such an Empire, with thirty millions of subjects,
was not to be lost for trifles. Yet, on the other hand, the faith
of Charters, the rights of property! I hesitate and tremble.
Such an innovation would at least require that the remedy
should be as certain as the evil, and the proprietors may perhaps
insinuate, that <em>they</em> were as competent Guardians of their own
affairs, as either *George North or L. Lewisham.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>* Their acting
without a salary seems childish, and their not being removable
by the Crown is a strange and dangerous precedent.</p>

<p>But enough of politics, which I now begin to view through a
thin, cold, distant cloud, yet not without a reasonable degree of
curiosity and patriotism. From the papers (especially when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
add an occasional slice of the Chronicle) I shall be amply informed
of facts and debates; from you I expect the causes rather
than the events, the true springs of action, and those interesting
anecdotes which seldom ascend the garret of a Fleet-Street editor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD NORTH'S INSIGNIFICANCE.</div>

<p>You say that many friends (alias acquaintance) have expressed
curiosity and concern; I should not wish to be immediately
forgot. That others (you once mentioned Gerard Hamilton)
condemn Government for suffering the departure of a man who
might have done them some credit and some service, perhaps as
much as Antony Storer himself. To you, in the confidence of
friendship, and without either pride or resentment, I will fairly
own that I am somewhat of Gerard's opinion; and if I did not
compare it with the rest of his character, I should be astonished
that Lord N[orth] suffered me to depart, without even a civil
answer to my letter. Were I capable of hating a man, whom it is
not easy to hate, I should find myself most amply revenged by the
insignificance of the creature in this mighty revolution of India,
his own peculiar department. But the happy Souls in paradise
are susceptible only of love and pity, and though Lausanne is
not a paradise, more especially in Winter, I do assure you, in
sober prose, that it has hitherto fulfilled, and even surpassed, my
warmest expectation. Yet I often cast a look toward Sheffield-place,
where you now repose, if you can repose, during the
Christmas recess.</p>

<p>Embrace My Lady, the young Baroness, and the gentle
Louisa, and insinuate to your silent Consort, that separate
letters require separate answers. Had I an air balloon, the great
topic of modern Conversation, I would call upon you till the
meeting of parliament. <em>Vale.</em>*</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, December 27th, 1783.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>Were we strangers to each other, I might amuse myself
with deducing the causes of my silence; the long expectation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
your answer and the propriety of taking a clear view of the
ground on which I stood before I could transmit a just and
satisfactory account of my situation. But it will be better to
acknowledge that the old man, my ancient and habitual enemy,
touched me with his wand, and that I am just awakening from
the enchanted slumber. My silence however may be fairly interpreted
as an evidence of content. Indeed, my Dear Madam,
I <em>am</em> happy, with as few exceptions as the condition of human
Nature will allow, and among the first of these exceptions I reckon
the interval of time and space which separates me from Bath.</p>

<p>Since I formed and executed this plan of retiring into Switzerland
I have not once repented, I have not felt a single moment of
disappointment, and my only regret is the having so long neglected
to obey the dictates of my reason; a more early obedience would
have saved me some years of dependance, of anxiety, and of indiscretion.
I have always valued far above the external gifts of
rank and fortune two qualities for which I stand indebted to the
indulgence of Nature, a strong and constant passion for letters,
and a propensity to view and to enjoy every object in the most
favourable light. The first has composed the daily happiness of
my life and ensured the perpetual enjoyment of the most pleasing
labours; the success of my works has given me a pure and
extensive, perhaps a permanent reputation, and if the more substantial
rewards have too easily slipped through my hands, I must
ascribe their loss to the obstinancy with which I struggled to
support a style of life to which the remains of my fortune were
no longer adequate.</p>

<p>My propensity to be happy has been exercised on the most
unfavourable materials; you have commonly seen a smile on
my conversation and my letters, and as you never distrusted
the sincerity of my professions you must have been surprized
at the success of my endeavours. Yet what could be more
adverse to my character than the life which for some years
past I have led in London. With the warmest love of independence
I have stooped the slave of Ministers. Without talents, or
at least without resolution for a public life, I have consumed days
and nights a silent spectator of noisy and factious debates. Conscious
that true happiness is founded on &oelig;conomy, the disorderly
state of my affairs has never allowed me to measure my income
and my expence, and I have never dared to cast my eyes on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
disbursment of the past or the supplies of the future year. How
different is the prospect which I now enjoy. I find myself in a
state of perfect independence and real affluence, and if I continue
to enjoy a tolerable state of health, I cannot easily discover what
event is capable of disturbing my tranquillity.</p>

<p>Among the ingredients of happiness you will agree with me in
giving the preference to a sincere and sensible friend; and though
you are not acquainted with half his merit, you will believe that
Deyverdun answers that description. Perhaps two persons so
perfectly fitted for each other were never created by Nature
and education. Our studies, occupations, and reflexions have been
sufficiently various to ensure a constant fund of entertainment; the
lights and shades of our respective characters are happily blended;
freedom and confidence are the basis of our union, and a friendship
of thirty years has taught us to enjoy and to support each other.
You have often read and heard the descriptions of this delightful
Country, the banks of the lake of Geneva, and indeed it surpasses
all description. A stranger is struck with surprize and admiration,
and it is endeared to me by the remembrance of my youth and
the lively attachment which I have always retained for the place
and the people. Our autumn has been beautiful, and the winter
has not hitherto been severe, but the season of rural enjoyments
is for some time suspended and our comforts are confined to
the fireside. M. Deyverdun's house is spacious and convenient,
and his garden, which spreads over a various and extensive spot,
unites every beauty and advantage both of town and country.
But into this paradise we are not yet introduced; the family to
whom he had lent or let the larger part of the house have started
some difficulties about the time of their removal, and till the
month of March or April we are obliged to content ourselves with
a convenient ready furnished lodging. When to this disappointment
I add that my boxes of books which were sent through
France still loiter on the road, you will confess that my felicity in
the approaching year is more likely to encrease than to diminish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAILY LIFE AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>With regard to the daily enjoyments of life, which rolls away
in a quiet uniform tenor, they are made to be felt rather than to
be related. I rise before eight, and our mornings are commonly
invisible to each other. At two (an hour somewhat too early) we
dine, one, two, or three agreably very often enliven our board,
which is served with decent elegance. From four to between six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and seven we read some amusing book, play at chess, retire to our
rooms, look into the Coffee house, or make visits. The assemblies
are numerous, and I play my three rubbers at shilling or half-crown
whist with tolerable pleasure. They end between nine and
ten, and a bit of bread and cheese, with some friendly converse,
sends us to bed about eleven. This sober plan is indeed interrupted
by too frequent suppers, which I want resolution to refuse,
though I behave with exemplary temperance. Instead of lolling
in a coach I walk the streets at all hours wrapped in a fur Cloak&mdash;the
exercise is wholesome, and in my life I never enjoyed more
perfect health and spirits. May you be able to say as much! If
vanity and Deyverdun do not deceive me, I am already a general
favourite, and as likings or dislikes are commonly mutual, I am
pleased with the manners of the place, and the worthy and
amiable characters of many individuals of both sexes.</p>

<p>Believe me, My dear Madam, I never cast a look on the politics
or the amusements of London. The mob of political connections
or casual acquaintance are unworthy of the regret of a rational
mind. But in the midst of a very pleasant life and society I am
not insensible of my separation from yourself, the Sheffields, and
two or three real friends. If their zeal should succeed in procuring
me any adequate office which I could accept with propriety and
exercise without disgust, if Government should find any situation
in which I could do them service and myself credit, I would quit
(perhaps with a sigh) this agreable retreat, and obey without
hesitation the calls of friendship, of honour, and of my Country.</p>

<h2>489.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, January 24th, 1784.
</p>

<p>*Within two or three days after your last <em>gracious</em> Epistle, your
Complaints were silenced, and your enquiries were satisfied, by an
ample dispatch of four pages, which overflowed the inside of the
cover, and in which I exposed my opinions of things in general,
public as well as private, as they existed in my mind, in my state
of ignorance and error, about the eighteenth or twentieth of last
month. Within a week after that date I epistolised, in the same
rich and copious strain, the two venerable females of Newman-street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and the Belvidere,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> whose murmur must now be changed
into songs of gratitude and applause. My correspondence with
the holy Matron of Northamptonshire<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> has been less lively and
loquacious. You have not forgotten the Atheist's vindication of
himself from the foul calumnies of pretended Christians; within
a fortnight after his arrival at Lausanne, he communicated the
joyful event to Mrs. G. She answered <em>per</em> return of post, both
letters at the same time, and in very dutiful language, almost
excusing her advice, which was intended for my spiritual, as well
as temporal, good, and assuring me that <em>nobody should be able to
injure me with her</em>. Unless the Saint is an hypocrite, possible
enough, such an expression must convey a favourable and important
meaning: at all events, it is worth giving <em>ourselves</em> some
trouble about her, without indulging any sanguine expectations
of inheritance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DELIGHT IN LORD SHEFFIELD'S LETTERS.</div>

<p>So much for my females. With regard to my male Correspondents,
you are the only one to whom I have given any
signs of my existence, though I have formed many a generous
resolution. Yet I am not insensible of the kind and friendly
manner in which Lord Loughborough has distinguished me: he
could have no inducements of interest, and now that I view the
distant picture with an impartial eye, I am convinced that (for a
Statesman) he was sincere though not earnest in his wishes to serve
me. When you see <em>him</em>, the Paynes, Eden, Crauford, &amp;c., tell
them that I am well, happy, and ashamed. On your side, the zeal
and diligence of your pen has surprized and delighted me, and
your letters, at this interesting moment, are exactly such as I
wished them to be&mdash;authentic anecdotes, and rational speculations,
worthy of a man who acts a part in the great theatre, and who
fills a seat, not only in the general Pandæmonium, but in the
private council of the princes of the infernal Regions. With
regard to the detail of Parliamentary operations, I must repeat my
request to you, or rather to Miss Firth, who will now be on the
spot, that she will write, not with her pen, but her Scissars, and
that, after every debate which deserves to pass the Sea and the
Mountains, she will dissect the faithful narrative of Woodfall,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
send it off by the next post, as an agreeable supplement to the
meagre accounts of our weekly papers.</p>

<p>The wonderful revolutions of last month<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> have sounded to
my ear more like the shifting scenes of a Comedy or Comic
Opera, than like the sober events of real and modern history;
and the irregularity of our winter posts, which sometimes retarded,
and sometimes hastened, the arrival of the dispatches,
has encreased the confusion of our ideas. Surely the Lord has
blinded the eyes of Pharaoh and of his servants; the obstinacy
of the last spring<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> was nothing compared to the headstrong
and headlong madness of this Winter. I expect with much
impatience the first days of your meeting: the purity and integrity
of the Coalition will suffer a fiery tryal; but if they are
true to themselves and to each other, a Majority of the House of
Commons must prevail; the rebellion of the young Gentlemen
will be crushed, and the Masters will resume the Government of
the School. After the address and answer,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> I have no conception
that Parliament can be dissolved during the Session; but if the
present Ministry can outlive the storm, I think the death Warrant
will infallibly be signed in the summer. <em>Here</em> I blush for my
Country, without confessing her shame. Fox acted like a man of
Honour, yet surely his union with Pitt affords the only hope of
salvation. How miserably are we wasting the season of peace!</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SALE OF HIS SEAT.</div>

<p>I have written three pages before I come to my own busyness
and feelings. In the first place, I most sincerely rejoyce that I
left the ship, and swam ashore on a plank; the daily and hourly
agitation in which I must have lived would have made me truly
miserable, if I had obtained a place during pleasure, Storer's for
instance. On the first news of the dissolution, I considered my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
seat as so totally and irrecoverably gone, that I have been less
affected with Sir Harry's obstinacy.* Yet his absolute refusal to
treat throws us at least for the present into a very uncomfortable
situation, and besides the danger of shipwreck, every day's
voyage diminishes the value of the ship and cargo. You say you
are schemeless. I can think only of two expedients.</p>

<p>1. You know or can know Sir Andrew Hammond, who is a fair
and honourable character. Talk over the business and kinsman
fairly with him, and tempt him to exert himself by the lowness of
the price. I should consider even five or six hundred pounds as
so much saved out of the fire, and a part of that sum would be most
deliciously employed in the embellishment of my new habitation.</p>

<p>2. The other scheme is somewhat more delicate, yet I cannot
esteem myself as bound to sacrifice my essential interest to that
motley crew surnamed a Coalition, nor does this superiority in
Parliament depend on the loss of <em>half-a-vote</em>. Perhaps the new
Minister would give Sir Harry for his relations those scandalous
jobs which our late friends more conscientiously refused, and many
a Candidate would purchase their effectual recommendation by
giving me the £1000 or £1200. On this occasion remember you
are acting for a <em>poor</em> friend; dismiss a little of the spirit of
faction and patriotism, and stoop to a prudential line of conduct,
which in your own case you might possibly disdain. If you
attempt the negociation you will easily find the proper instruments,
but I should think James Grenville, the Lord of the
Treasury, a safe and convenient channel, and I am persuaded
that he would embrace the opportunity of serving his party and
obliging <em>me</em> at the same time. In the business of Lenborough
you may be active, but I can only be passive to convey a fair
Estate, and to receive a miserable pittance of three thousand and
some pounds. I hope nothing will happen to perplex the title or
to delay the payment, and that the sum will be safely lodged for
my account and in Gosling's hands before the end of February.</p>

<p>*Perhaps you will abuse my prudence and patriotism, when I
inform you, that I have already vested a part (30,000 Livres,
about £1300) in the new loan of the King of France. I get eight
per Cent. on the joint lives of Deyverdun and myself, besides
thirty tickets in a very advantageous Lottery, of which the
highest prize is an annuity of 40,000 Livres (£1700) a year. At
this moment, the beginning of a peace, and probably a long peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
I think (and the World seems to think) the French funds at least
as solid as our own. I have empowered my Agent, M. de Lessart,
a capital banker at Paris, to draw upon Gosling for the money two
months hence; and to avoid all accidents that may result from
untoward delays, and mercantile churlishness, I expect that you
will support my credit in Fleet-street with your own more respectable
name.* Moreover when Lenborough purchase money is paid,
I wish it were possible to withhold £1000 or 1500 of their mortgage
on our joint bond; I could employ it to my satisfaction at
present, and should certainly repay it in three or four years on
the conclusion of my History. Perhaps you will be better reconciled
to my pecuniary arrangements by the proposal which I
seriously make of purchasing Lee's farm at Buriton, if it can be
obtained for 25 years' purchase after deducting the Land Tax.
My interest without principal will be compensated by principal
without interest (you remember Soame Jenyns's definition), and
whatever becomes of my French Creditor, my Hampshire acres
will be safe, compact, and in due time clear of all incumbrances.
You may consult with Hugonin, propose and conclude.</p>

<p>*What say you now? Am I not a wise Man? My letter is
enormous, and the post on the wing. In a few days I will write
to my Lady herself, and enter something more into the details of
domestic life. Suffice it to say, that the scene becomes each day
more pleasant and comfortable, and that I complain only of the
dissipation of Lausanne. In the course of March or April we
shall take possession of Deyverdun's house. My books, which by
some strange neglect, did not leave Paris till the 3rd of this
Month, will arrive in a few weeks; and I shall soon resume the
continuation of my history, which I shall prosecute with the more
vigour, as the completion affords me a distant prospect of a visit
to England.* A-propos, if the box which I left in Downing Street
for the Swiss Carrier be not already departed, I hope Elmsley and
yourself will give it a speedy and vigorous shove; when you see
Elmsley ask him whether he has answered my letters: he is
almost as lazy as myself. To my Lady's taste I shall entrust the
Wedgewood's ware, which in the course of the spring or summer
may accompany some other boxes of plate, linnen, books which I
shall probably invoke. Adieu. I embrace my Lady and Infants.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, February 2nd, 1784.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Baron!</span>&mdash;
</p>

<p>*After my last enormous dispatch, nothing can remain,
except some small gleanings, or occasional hints; and thus in
order: I am not conscious that any of your valuable MSS. have
miscarried, or that I have omitted to answer any essential particulars.
They stand in my Bureau carefully arranged, and
docketed under the following dates; September 23, October 23,
November 18, December 2, December 15, December 19, December
23, December 29, January 16, which last I have received this day,
Febr. 2nd. For greater perspicuity, it will not be amiss (on
either side) to number our future Epistles, by a conspicuous
Roman character inscribed in the front, to which we may at any
time refer. But instead of writing by Ostend, the shorter and
surer way, especially on all occasions that deserve celerity, will be
to direct them to my Banker, M. de Lessert, at Paris, who will
forward them to me. Through Germany the passage by Sea is
more uncertain, the roads worse, and the distance greater: we
often complain of delay and irregularity at this interesting
moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FACTIOUS OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>By your last I find that you have boldly and generously
opened a treaty with the Enemy, which I proposed with fear and
hesitation. I impatiently expect the result; and again repeat, that
<em>whatever</em> you can obtain* for the seat, *I shall consider it as so
much saved out of the fire, &amp;c. &amp;c.* I shall then have completely
secured a tranquil though humble station, and my personal happiness
will no longer hang in suspense upon every change of
Ministry, and every vote of Parliament. I am not surprized that
you grow sulky: your free and liberal spirit must disdain a set of
Men, whose aim is their own restoration to power, and whose
means may affect the principles of the Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> *Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
remember Dunning's motion<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> (in the year 80) to address the
Crown against a dissolution of Parliament? a simple address we
rejected, as an infringement on the prerogative; yet how far short
of these strong Democratical measures, for which you have
probably voted, as I should probably have done: such is the
contagion of party. Fox drives most furiously, yet I should not
be surprized if Pitt's moderation and character should insensibly
win the Nation, and even the house, to espouse his cause.*</p>

<p>Lenborough is a melancholy and unpleasant subject. I am
grateful for your endeavours, and lament that your reflexions on the
value of land and money are but too true and sensible. Greatly
as I have been disappointed in the price, I should now be sorry
that anything should happen to break the bargain or to delay the
payment. The surmise of such a possible event obliged me to
repeat my commands that you would instruct Gosling (in your
own name) to accept M. de Lessert's draught on the 20th of March
for 30,000 French Livres (about £1300). Whatever you may
think of my economical measures, the deed is done, and my
honour is now pledged for the performance. The other sum,
£1000 or 1500 of the Lenborough price which I wished to deduct
from the mortgage, is a more indifferent speculation, which should
only take place as far as it is agreable to all parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL OF HIS LIBRARY.</div>

<p>*Unless when I look back on England with a selfish or a tender
regard, my hours roll away very pleasantly, and I can again repeat
with truth, that I have not regretted a single moment the step
which I have taken. We are now at the height of the Winter dissipation,
and I am peculiarly happy when I can steal away from
great assemblies, and suppers of twenty or thirty people, to a more
private party, of some of those persons whom I begin to call my
friends. Till we are settled in our house little can be expected on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
our side; yet I have already given two or three handsome dinners;
and though everything is grown dearer, I am not alarmed at the
general view of my expence. Deyverdun salutes you; and we are
agreed that few married Couples are better entitled to the flitch
of bacon than we shall be at the end of the year. When I had
written about half this Epistle my books arrived; at our first
meeting all was rapture and confusion, and two or three posts,
from the 2nd to this day, the fourteenth, have been suffered to
depart unnoticed. Your letter of the 27th of January, which was
not received till yesterday, has again awakened me, and I thought
the surest way would be to send off this single sheet without any
farther delay.</p>

<p>I sincerely rejoice in the stability of Parliament;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and the first
faint dawn of reconciliation, which must however be effected by
the equal balance of parties, rather than by the wisdom of the
Country Gentlemen.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>*</p>


<p class="open"><br />
<span class="smcap">Miss Firth</span>,
</p>

<p>After due salutations I trouble you with three or four
Commissions, which I should not presume to offer to the greatness
of the Baron or the delicacy of My Lady, but which I am
persuaded you will chearfully undertake to oblige an old and
sincere friend. 1. The employment which I have already hinted
of your scissars in carving and despatching occasional debates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
from Woodfall's paper. 2. You are desired to call on Elmsley to
ask him from time to time when he wrote to me last, and to urge
him about taking and sending a Catalogue of my library with all
convenient or inconvenient speed. 3. As many things will be
deficient and as carriage will be less expensive than purchase, I
propose sending for my plate, linnen, and China which now lye
in Downing Street. My Agent Prendergast, an honest Cabinet
maker, has received his instructions from Caplen, and I only
desire that when he calls for that purpose he may have free
permission to examine, pack, export, &amp;c. A list was entrusted
to Lord Sheffield which might be compared, copied, signed by
him and transmitted by the post to me.</p>

<h2>491.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, March 2nd, 1784.
</p>

<p>Your despatch of Feb. 13th arrived safe yesterday, March 1st,
and notwithstanding the winter obstacles of seas and roads there
is, upon the whole, more delay than danger in the transactions of
the posts. I am glad that my last appearance in Downing Street
put an end to a course of abuse; but in spite of my profound
veneration for dreams and omens, I flatter myself that the silence
of <em>one month</em> will not always be interpreted as a certain testimony
that I no longer exist. Before I quit the subject of dispatches,
one word on Miss Firth's scissors whose operation you have so
prudently checked. Their use was not intended to be daily but
occasional, on some great and memorable debate in the Pandemonium.
Such occasions might occur twenty or thirty times
in the winter, and at one shilling each time the annual expence
might have exceeded <em>one</em> Guinea. I had computed that such expence
might be supported; but if you persist in a contrary opinion,
I must submit.</p>

<p>You had given me notice that the purchase money of Lenborough
would be paid in February, and as the title was so
perfectly clear, I suppose the surplus (far beyond the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the Paris draught) is already in Gosling's hands, payable to my
order. In that case I shall have no obligations to them for
obeying my Commands. But as I was aware of the delays of the
law, and of their narrow mercantile temper, I did conceive that
they might scruple paying Mr. de Lessert's draught for 30,000
Livres <em>some days</em> before my money was actually in their shop.
The French banker will draw at sight, but instead of the 20th of
March, I have postponed his draught till the 20th of April. In
due time I shall write to the Goose to give them notice not to ask
a favour. It is to you only that I wish to be obliged, and if you
inform them that you consider yourself as answer for the money,
I cannot suspect that even their grovelling spirit will have any
scruples. If instead of your word they should require your bond,
you can give it in five minutes, and a few days when the purchase
money is paid will release you from the obligation. The general
comparison of the French and English funds I have not time to
discuss. I think them more able, and ourselves more willing, to
support our national faith, but if a man must trust his money
to the Ocean, I think it more advisable to embark it on two
separate bottoms. With regard to the scruples of the two Tabbies,
I can only say that first they need not know anything of the
matter, and secondly they will be so good as to allow me to think

<div class="sidenote">A HAPPY WINTER OF STUDY AND SOCIETY.</div>

<p>With regard to the purchase of Lee's farm I am serious,
and if I am abused for my follies I must have some credit for
the more rational parts of my Conduct. At least you will give
me credit when I declare that in a happy winter of study and
society I have not once regretted the noise of St. Stephen's and
the tiresome suspense of your incomprehensible politics, but I do
most sincerely regret the decreasing value of my Senatorial commodity.
As soon as you can, and as much as you can, is the advice
which you will follow without my having the trouble of giving it.
But in the meanwhile do not let us quarrel about the disposal of
the Bearskin. I am not mad, nor do I mean to settle here for
life. A small part of the indefinite price of my seat was destined
to embelish my habitation, and if, after enjoying the comforts
three or four years, I should leave my friend's house somewhat
improved, I can see nothing very extravagant in the idea.</p>

<p>Thus far I have written before the departure of the post, and
am preparing to pass the evening at a private representation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Barbier de Seville, which will be followed by a lively and excellent
supper. Embrace My Lady. I think of her often, especially every
post day. Say a kind word to Kitty, I shall soon dream that she
is dead likewise.&mdash;Gosling need not be apprized of the object of
the Paris draught.&mdash;The additional £1500 which I wished to
retain is superfluous, as I have already observed in my last.</p>

<p>You are or will be astonished with some farther orders for the
march of plate, linnen, books, &amp;c., but I am of opinion that the
present moment is worth enjoying, and that carriage, even double
carriage, is less expensive than purchase.&mdash;You have nothing to do
with Wedgewood, but I shall soon consult My lady. The spring
is delightful. I often snatch a walk on Deyverdun's terrace, and
visit my books, which are already deposited, but I fear the house
will not be accessible before the first of May. He says I am not
patient, I say he is indolent; you know that the most harmonious
pairs will sometime squabble.</p>

Lausanne, April 31st, 1784.
</p>

<p>Not a post has elapsed without my thinking of Sheffelina
and intending her separate letter. This day which had been
peremptorily fixed is now so far advanced that I have barely
time to relieve my mind from some anxious <em>English</em> thoughts,
the only ones that disturb the tranquil, chearful scenes of my
well-judged retreat.&mdash;I have this moment perused the last English
papers of the 20th instant, which contain by the bye your smart
and as it seems successful dispute with the Minister.</p>

<p>Your adversaries (I fear they are the King, Lords and People)
have now conquered, but at this distance I cannot discern the
consequences of their victory, whether it will lead to treaty or dissolution.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
If the latter, adieu once more to my poor seat and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
my little hopes of compensation. Can nothing, nothing be done
in any way by direct or indirect, by humble or strenuous measures?
Upon my soul, I should consider my election dinner, £100, or 200
pounds as a tolerable conclusion of my cursed political life. But in
this business perhaps you can do nothing. I therefore turn to
another, which would seriously alarm me, had I less confidence in
your friendship. You know (and the Goslings are apprized) that
on the 20th of April M. de Lessert of Paris will draw upon
them for 30,300 French Livres, and I should feel the deepest
shame and affliction if his draught in my name should meet with
an unfavourable reception. I am in your hands, and can say no
more. Perhaps I have been too hasty, yet you cannot forget
that I might reasonably act on your assurance of the Lenborough
purchase money being paid before the end of February. Since
that notice you have never said a word on the subject. Is
the business concluded? what occasions a delay? Have any
difficulties arisen? Adieu. You grow an idle correspondent.
The winter has been long but not extremely rigorous.&mdash;The
person who occupies Deyverdun's house is an invalid; yet I
think we shall migrate before my birthday, the 8th of May.</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 11th, 1784.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>*Alas! alas! alas! We may now exchange our mutual
condolence, and encourage each other to support with becoming
fortitude the stroke of fate. Last Christmas, on the change of
administration, I was struck with the thunderbolt of the
unexpected event, and in the approaching dissolution I foresaw
the loss of* the little but precious stock which I had so foolishly
embarked in the parliamentary bottom. *The long continuance
and various changes of the tempest rendered me by degrees
callous and insensible: when the art of the Mariners was
exhausted, I felt that we were sinking; I expected the ship to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
founder; and when the fatal moment arrived, I was even pleased
to be delivered from hope and fear, to the calmness of despair.</p>

<p>I now turn my eyes, not on the past, but on the present and
the future; what is lost I try to consider as if it never had existed;
and every day I congratulate my own good fortune, let me say
my prudence and resolution, in migrating from your noisy stage
to a scene of repose and content. But even in this separate
state, I was still anxious for my friend upon English Earth,
and at first was much delighted with your hint, that you were
setting off for Coventry, without any prospect of an opposition.
Every post, Wednesdays and Saturdays, I eagerly looked for the
intelligence of your victory; and in spite of my misbehaviour,
which I do not deny, I must abuse <em>My Lady</em>, rather than you,
for leaving me in so painful a situation. Each day raised and
increased my apprehension; the Courier de l'Europe first
announced the contest, the English papers proclaimed your
defeat, and your last letter, which I received four days ago,
showed me that you exerted first the spirit, and at last the temper,
of a hero. Lord B[eauchamp] behaved as I should have expected,
and I am not much surprized that you should have been swept
away in the general unpopularity, since even in this quiet place,
your friends are considered as a factious crew, acting in direct
opposition both to the King and People.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>For yourself I am at a loss what to say. If this repulse
should teach you to renounce all connexion with Kings and
Ministers, and patriots, and parties, and parliaments; for all
of which you are by many degrees too honest; I should exclaim,
with Teague,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> your respectable countryman, "By my Shoul,
Dear Joy, you have <em>gained</em> a loss." Private life, whether
contemplative or active, has surely more solid and independent
charms; you have <em>some</em> domestic comforts; Sheffield is still
susceptible of useful and ornamental improvements, (alas! how
much better might even the last £1500 have been laid out!)
and if these cares are not sufficient to occupy your leisure, I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
trust your restless and enterprizing spirit to find new methods
of preserving yourself from the insipidity of repose. But I much
fear your discontent and regret at being excluded from that
Pandæmonium which we have so often cursed, as long as you
were obliged to attend it. The leaders of the party will flatter
you with the opinion of their friendship and your own importance;
the warmth of your temper makes you credulous and unsuspicious;
and, like the rest of our species, male and female, you are not
absolutely blind to your own merit, or deaf to the voice of praise.
Some place will be suggested, easy, honourable, certain, where
nothing is wanted but a man of character and spirit to head
a superior interest; the opposition, if any, is contemptible, and
the expence cannot be large. You will go down, find almost
every circumstance falsely stated, repent that you had engaged
yourself, but you cannot desert those friends who are firmly
attached to your cause; besides, the Money you have already
spent would have been thrown away; another thousand will
compleat the business: deeper and deeper will you plunge, and
the last evil will be worse than the first.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FREE-SPOKEN COUNSELLOR.</div>

<p>You see I am a free-spoken Counsellor; may I not be a true
prophet! Did I consult my own wishes, I should observe to you,
that as you are no longer a Slave, you might soon be transported,
as you seem to desire, to one of the Alpine hills. The purity and
calmness of the air is the best calculated to allay the heat of
a political feaver; the education of the two princesses might be
successfully conducted under your eye and that of my Lady; and
if you had resolution to determine on a residence, not a visit, at
Lausanne, your worldly affairs might repose themselves after their
late fatigues. But you know that <em>I</em> am a friend to toleration,
and am always disposed to make the largest allowance for the
different natures of animals; a lion and a lamb, an eagle and
a Worm. I am afraid we are too quiet for you; here it would
not be easy for you to create any business; you have for some
time neglected books, and I doubt whether you would not think
our suppers and assemblies somewhat trifling and insipid.</p>

<p>For myself I am happy to tell, and you will be happy to hear,
that this place has in every respect exceeded my best and most
sanguine hopes. How often have you said, as often as I expressed
any ill-humour against the hurry, the expence, and the precarious
condition of my London life, "Ay, that is a nonsensical scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of retiring to Lausanne that you have got into your head&mdash;a
pretty fancy; you remember how much you liked it in your
youth, but you have now seen more of the World, and if you
were to try it again, you would find yourself most woefully
disappointed"? I had it in my head, in my heart; I have
tryed it; I have not been disappointed; and my knowledge of
the World has only served to convince me, that a Capital and
a Crowd may contain much less real society, than the small circle
of this gentle retirement. The winter has been longer, but, as
far as I can learn, less rigorous than in the rest of Europe. The
spring in all its glory is now bursting upon us, and in our garden
it is displayed in all its glory. I already occupy a temporary
apartment, and we live in the lower part of the house; before
you receive this our lodgers will be gone and we shall be in full
possession. We have much to enjoy and something to do, which
I take to be the happiest condition of human life.</p>

<p>Now for business, the kind of subject which I always undertake
with the most reluctance, and leave with the most pleasure.* I do
not thank you for standing between me and Gosling, you would
despise my thanks. I know your sentiments, and you are not
ignorant of mine. But the step on your side was necessary:
even with your security Gosling has not done the thing in a
graceful way, and even the letter which informs me that he will
honour M. de Lessert's draught is written with unnecessary
pertness. In a post or two I shall probably hear the payment
acknowledged from Paris. The Goose hopes he shall soon be
reimbursed: so do I likewise, and as no difficulties can arise with
regard to the title, I should imagine that before you leave town
the business, that is the payment, may be finally concluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH FRIENDS AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>Of the persons who already cast a Hawk's eye on the poor
surplus. There is one Harris whose bond, since he calls for it, must
undoubtedly be discharged, though I should be glad if you could
persuade him to be contented with the interest, and trust me
some time longer with the principal. I write to Whitehead, the
hirer of horses, by this post, and suppose you will hear no more
of him. But I must confess that Richard Way's demand of
one hundred Guineas fills me with surprize and indignation,
and, unless you are decidedly of a contrary opinion, I do most
absolutely refuse it. Had he only been useless something might
be pleaded; but if you recollect that his entire service was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
recommending me to Lovegrove, it would not be easy to
compute the damages (for thousands) for which I might equitably
sue that Land Jobber. Though I am not very favourably
disposed to the Goslings, the surplus money, when the just
demands are cleared, must be left in their hands, till I can
employ it, but I am serious in my hint about Lee's farm, and
wish you would correspond with Hugonin in the summer; by
the bye, he has not pressed my tenants this winter. A Swiss
Carrier by name Pache will call in a few days to send away the
boxes of plate, linnen, china, which are probably packed for
foreign service. The ornamental China was never intended to
be sent.</p>

<p>Postscript.</p>

<p>I cannot as yet hear anything of a certain box left at my
departure in Downing-place, and repeatedly and vainly demanded;
by this time I hope that it is on the road. Elmsley, to whom
it was peculiarly committed, is an ingenious, an honest, but a
very idle fellow. The box contains some absolute necessaries,
such as paper in particular, and you are a sufferer by the delay,
as you will pay a double letter for the value, or at least the size,
of a single one. The stationer's paper here is so extremely thin
that I turned over two leaves at once, and the error is now
irreparable. Adieu.</p>

<p>*And now, My Lady.</p>

<p>Let me approach your gentle, not grimalkin, presence, with
deep remorse. You have indirectly been informed of my state
of mind and body; (the whole winter I have not had the slightest
return of the Gout, or any other complaint whatsoever;) you
have been apprized, and are now apprized, of my motions, or
rather of my perfect and agreeable repose; yet I must confess
(and I <em>feel</em>) that something of a direct and personal exchange
of sentiment has been neglected on my side, though I still
<em>persuade</em> myself that when I am settled in my new house I shall
have more subject, as well as leisure to write. Such tricks of
lazyness your active spirit is a stranger to, though Mrs. Frazer
complains that she has never had an answer to her last letters.*
That aforesaid little Donna Catharina arrived here three or four
days with her sister Miss Bristow: the widow is impatient to
reach England: the maiden, who is much better, proposes staying
here the whole summer with her dear Doctor Tissot, and returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
on the approach of Winter to pass another season at Nice. *Poor
Lady Pembroke!<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> <em>you</em> will feel for her; after a cruel alternative
of hope and fear, her only daughter, Lady Charlotte, died at Aix
at Provence; they have persuaded her to come to this place,
where she is intimately connected with the Cerjat family. She
has taken an agreeable house, about three miles from the town,
and lives retired. But I have seen her; her behaviour is calm,
but her affliction&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I accept with gratitude your friendly proposal of Wedgewood's
ware, and should be glad to have it bought and packed,
and sent without delay through Germany.* To you I leave
the absolute and <em>sole</em> command, but if you have a mind to
consult the Baron with regard to the ornamental, the creature
is not totally devoid of taste: the number, choice, pattern, sizes,
&amp;c. you will determine, and *I shall only say, that I wish to have
a very compleat service for two courses and a desert, and that
our suppers are numerous, frequently fifteen or twenty persons.
Adieu. I do not mean this as your letter. You are very good
to poor Kitty. With you I do not condole about Coventry.*</p>

<h2>494.</h2>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 28th, 1784.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>*I begin without preface or Apology, as if I had received
your letter by the last post. In my own defence I know not
what to say; but if I were disposed to recriminate, I might
observe that you yourself are not perfectly free from the sin of
laziness and procrastination. I have often wondered why we are
not fonder of letter-writing: we all delight to talk of ourselves,
and it is only in letters, in writing to a friend, that we can enjoy
that conversation, not only without reproach or interruption,
but with the highest propriety and mutual satisfaction; sure
that the person whom we address feels an equal, or at least a
strong and lively interest in the consideration of the pleasing
subject. On the subject therefore of <em>self</em> I will entertain a friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to whom none of my thoughts or actions, none of my pains or
pleasures can ever be indifferent.</p>

<p>When I first cherished the design of retiring to Lausanne,
the loss I can hardly call it of your society, but at least of
your neighbourhood, and the fear of your anxiety and disapprobation
have always stood before me as the most powerful
objections, and I was much more apprehensive of wounding your
tender attachment, than of offending Lord Sheffield's manly
and vehement friendship. In the abolition of the board of
trade, the motives for my retreat became more urgent and
forcible; I wished to break loose, yet I delayed above a year
before I could take my final resolution; and the letter in which
I disclosed it to you cost me one of the most painful struggles
of my life. As soon as I had conquered that difficulty, all
meaner obstacles fell before me, and in a few weeks I found
myself at Lausanne, astonished at my firmness and my success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REIGN OF SINECURES AT AN END.</div>

<p>Perhaps you still blame or still lament the step which I have
taken. If on your own account, I can only sympathize with your
feelings, the recollection of which often costs me a sigh; If on
mine, let me fairly state what I have escaped in England, and
what I have found at Lausanne. Recollect the tempests of this
winter, how many anxious days I should have passed, how many
noisy, turbulent, hot, unwholesome nights, while my political
existence, and that of my friends, was at stake; yet these feeble
efforts would have been unavailing; I should have lost my seat
in Parliament, and after the extraordinary expence of another
Year, I must still have pursued the road of Switzerland, unless
I had been tempted by some selfish Patron, or by Lord S.'s
aspiring spirit, to purchase at a most inconvenient price a new
seat; and once more, at the beginning of an opposition, to
engage in new scenes of business. As to the immediate prospect
of any thing like a quiet and profitable retreat, I should not know
where to look; my friends are no longer in power. With *Pitt*
and his party I have no connection; and were he disposed to
favour a Man of letters, it is difficult to say what he could give,
or what I would accept. The reign of pensions and sinecures
is at an end, and a commission in the Excise or customs, the
summet of my hopes, would give me bread at the expence
of leisure and liberty. When I revolve these circumstances
in my mind, my only regret, I repeat it again and again, is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that I did not embrace this salutary measure three, five, ten
years ago.</p>

<p>Thus much I thought it necessary to say, and shall now dismiss
this unpleasing part of the subject. For my situation here,
health is the first consideration, and on that head your tenderness
had conceived some degree of anxiety. I know not whether it
has reached you that I had a fit of the Gout the day after
my arrival. The deed is true, but the cause was accidental;
carelessly stepping down a flight of stairs, I sprained my ancle;
and my ungenerous enemy instantly took advantage of my
weakness. But since my breaking that double chain, I have
enjoyed a winter of the most perfect health that I have perhaps
ever known, without any mixture of the little flying incommodities
which in my best days have sometimes disturbed the tranquillity
of my English life. You are not ignorant of Dr. Tissot's reputation,
and his merit is even above his reputation. He assures me,
that in his opinion, the moisture of England and Holland is
most pernicious, the dry pure air of Switzerland most favourable,
to a Gouty constitution: that experience justifies the Theory;
and that there are fewer martyrs of that disorder in this, than
in any other country in Europe.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">HIS HOUSE, TERRACE, AND GARDEN.</div>

<p>This winter has every where been most uncommonly severe;
and you seem in England to have had your full share of the
general hardship: but in this corner, surrounded by the Alps,
it has rather been long than rigorous; and its duration stole
away our spring, and left us no interval between furs and
silks. We now enjoy the genial influence of the Climate and
the Season; and no station was ever more calculated to enjoy
them than Deyverdun's house and garden, which are now
become my own. You will not expect that the pen should
describe, what the pencil would imperfectly delineate. A few
circumstances may, however, be mentioned. My library is
about the same size with that in Bentinck Street, with this
difference, however, that instead of looking on a paved court
twelve feet square, I command a boundless prospect of vale,
mountain, and water, from my three windows; my apartment
is compleated by a spacious light closet, or store-room, with
a bed-chamber and dressing-room. Deyverdun's habitation is
pleasant and convenient, though less extensive: for our common
use we have a very handsome winter apartment of four rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>;
and on the ground-floor, two cool saloons for the summer, with
a sufficiency, or rather superfluity, of offices, &amp;c. A Terrace, one
hundred yards long, extends beyond the front of the House, and
leads to a close impenetrable shrubbery; and from thence the
circuit of a long and various walk, carries me round a meadow
and vineyard. The intervals afford abundant supply of fruit,
and every sort of vegetables; and if you add, that this villa
(which has been much ornamented by my friend) touches the
best and most sociable part of the town, you will agree with me,
that few persons, either princes or philosophers, enjoy a more
desirable residence.</p>

<p>Deyverdun, who is proud of his own works, often walks
me round, pointing out, with knowledge and enthusiasm, the
beauties that change with every step and with every variation
of light. I share, or at least I sympathize, with his pleasure:
he appears content with my progress, and has already told
several people, that he does not despair of making me a
Gardener. Be that as it may, you will be glad to hear that
I am, by my own choice, infinitely more in motion, and in the
open air, than I ever have been formerly. Yet my perfect liberty
and leisure leave me many studious hours; and as the circle of
our acquaintance retire into the Country, I shall be much less
engaged in company and diversion. I have seriously resumed
the prosecution of my history; each day and each month adds
something to the completion of the great work. The progress
is slow, the labour continual, and the end remote and uncertain.
Yet every day brings its amusement, as well as labour; and
though I dare not fix a term, even in my own fancy, I advance,
with the pleasing reflection, that the business of publication
(should I be detained here so long) must enforce my return to
England, and restore me to the best of mothers and friends.</p>

<p>With health and competence, with a full independence of mind
and action, a delightful habitation, a true friend, and many
pleasant acquaintance, you will allow, in the meanwhile, that
I am rather an object of envy than pity; and if you were more
conversant with the use of the French language, I would seriously
propose to you to repose yourself with us in this fine country.
But my indirect intelligence (on which I sometimes depend with
more implicit faith than on the kind dissimulation of your friendship)
gives me reason to hope that the last winter has been more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
favourable to your health than the preceding one. Assure me
of it yourself honestly and truly, and you will afford me one
of the most lively pleasures* that I am capable of receiving.
Write soon, and <em>indeed</em> I will not be so tardy in my answer.
Caplin presents his duty to you. You will be sorry to hear that
he <em>seems</em> tolerably satisfied, and talks French (when I am not
present) like a magpye. The English who have passed the Winter
at Nice, Lady Pembroke, &amp;c., are flocking here. I am civil
without living among them, but you will rejoyce to hear that
Mr. and Madame Necker pass the summer in our neighbourhood.
I must request a short delay in your Midsummer draught as I
am ignorant whether some money is paid in, but it need not
exceed a fortnight or three weeks. Adieu.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, June 19th, 1784.
</p>

<p>The Goslings cannot do a handsome thing with a tolerable
grace. They have accepted and paid Lessert's draught, but
instead of taking your word or note or bond, for the entire sum
as a separate loan, they have eked it out by squeezing to the last
drop of between £300 and 400 of my cash in their hands without
leaving me a shilling to supply the necessary and current demands.
Alas, poor Lymington!! By this post I write to them, as well
as to the Darrels, and one way or another I must create some
temporary credit till the business of Lenborough is settled. When
in the Devil's name (for to him most rightfully belong all money
transactions) will it be concluded? Originally the purchase-money
was to be paid in February, we are now in the middle of June.
You have never suggested any impediments; even in your last
you say it is in a fair way, yet surely four or five extraordinary
months exceed even the common forms and delays of lawyers,
auctioneers, and all that unfeeling race of men. I cannot suspect
your friendship or diligence, yet possibly the Coventry election
and your more early retreat to Sheffield may have thrown you a
little out of the road: but I trust that you will soon recover your
lost ground (if any) and finish the race with speed and success.
You are sensible that it will deliver me from the remnant of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Worldly anxieties. If the purchaser is an honest and responsible
man, might he not be persuaded to advance £500 on the purchase-money;
no uncommon favour, and which now would be most
singularly acceptable. If, on the other hand, he shuffles through
weakness of mind or purse, I could support (in my present regular
economy) the idea of reserving the Estate till more prosperous
times, and of finding some real or <em>personal</em> security for the money
which the Goslings have advanced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS HOSPITALITIES.</div>

<p>*In this glorious season I frequently give tea and supper
to a dozen men and women with ease and reputation, and
heartily wish you and My Lady were among them. In this
corner of Europe we enjoy, or shall speedily enjoy, (besides
threescore English, with Lady Pembroke, and forty French,
with the Duchess de Sivrac at their head), M. et Madame
Necker, the Abbé Raynal, the Hereditary prince of Brunswick,
Prince Henry of Prussia,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> perhaps the Duke of Cumberland; yet
I am still more content with the humble natives, than with <em>most</em>
of these <em>illustrious names</em>. Adieu. The post is on the wing, and
you owe me a long Epistle. I am, as usual, in the firm intention
of writing next week to my lady.* I hear from Ostend of the
landing of four boxes: but I know not whether the Wedgewood is
among them. If not, I hope it will soon follow. Adieu.</p>

tremendous is the sleepy power of laziness and habit, that the

hand, and to freeze the <em>Epistolary</em> ink. How or when I should
have naturally awakened, I cannot tell; but the pressure of my
affairs, and the arrival of your last letter, compell me to remember
that you are entrusted with the final amputation of the best limb
of my property. The subject is in itself so painful, that I have
postponed it, like a child's physic, from day to day; and losing
whole mornings, as I walked about my library, in useless regret
and impotent resolution. You will be amazed to hear that (after
peeping to see that you were well, and returned from Ireland) I
have not yet had the courage to peruse your letter, for fear of
meeting with some gloomy intelligence; and I will now finish
what I have to say of pecuniary matters, before I know whether
its contents will fortify or overthrow my unbyassed sentiments.*</p>

<p>About three weeks ago I received the conveyance of Lenbourough,
and immediatly executed the deeds in the presence of
the Hon<sup>ble</sup> and Reverend Edward Conway, and Mr. Jones of Ireland,
a nephew of Lord Tyrone. A coach was setting off, and the
writings properly packed were directed to Mr. Elmsley, and in the
inner Cover to L<sup>d</sup> Sheffield to be left till called for: before this
time they should be safe in London; the purchaser is said to be
impatient. I am so likewise, and nothing (I should apprehend)
can prevent you from delivering the land and receiving the
Money. The miserable state of the funds must excuse the lowness
of the price, and annihilate any probable benefit of a short
delay: but when I look back (a foolish retrospect!) to our
moderate expectation of £20,000 and calculate the interest, money,
costs, vexations, &amp;c., of eleven Years, I cannot look upon myself
as a <em>very</em> successful man. Consider that since my departure I
have fairly or foully lost at least £2000 on which I might depend
with the most rational confidence, £1000 on the abatement of the
Lenborough price, and £1000 by the dissolution of Parliament.
*To what purpose (you will say) are these tardy and useless repinings?
To arraign your manager? No, I am satisfied with
the skill and firmness of the pilot, and only complain of the
untoward violence of the tempest. To repent of your retreat into
Switzerland? No, surely, every subsequent event has tended to
make it as necessary as it has proved agreeable. Why then these
lamentations? Hear and attend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS PECUNIARY AFFAIRS.</div>

<p>It is to interest (if possible more strongly) your zeal and
friendship, to justify a sort of avarice, of a love of money,
very foreign to my character, but with which I cling to these
last fragments of my fortune.* According to the terms of the
conveyance, £12,000 are destined for the Goslings and £3500 for
me, in all £15,500: yet I am almost sure that you mentioned
£15,650 as the entire price. Of this remainder, Gosling will
instantly seize his reimbursement of the Paris sum, £300 bond
and, as I fear, some small arrears of interest. Besides this
Harris's heirs have made a just claim; Way's damned hundred
Guineas I cannot digest, and a long unknown bill of Newton
rises to my imagination in all its horrors. Of tradesmen's debts I
have left none behind me except about 300 pounds for the hire of
horses to Whitehead and the purchase of books to Elmsley. When
all these demands are summed and discharged, I tremble at the
balance, and indeed I have found through life that I had always
more to pay, and less to receive, than I expected. *As far as I can
judge from the experience of a year, though I find Lausanne much
more expensive than I imagined, yet my style of living (and a
very handsome style it is) will be brought <em>nearly</em> within my
ordinary revenues. I wish our poor Country could say as much!
But it was always my favourite and rational wish, that at the
winding up of my affairs I might possess a sum from one to two
thousand pounds, neither buried in land, nor locked up in the
funds, but free, light, and ready to obey any call of interest, or
pleasure, or virtue; to defray any extraordinary expence, support
any delay, or remove any obstacle. For the attainment of this
object, I trust in your assistance.*</p>

<p>First, I must desire you to call in the bills (particularly Newton's)
to cast up the amount of all the deductions on the
£3500, and to send me the list, but to pay as little of it as you
possibly can (except the Goslings), till you have heard again
from me. I am sensible however that the residue can scarcely
by any contrivance be brought even to the smallest of the
above-mentioned sums (£1000), and here your friendship must
again interpose to engage the Goslings to supply that deficiency
on our Joint-bond. The money (I could wish it were £1500
in all) I should probably vest in India bonds, and the difference
of &frac12; or of 1 per Cent. would be no formidable tax. At the
end of three or four years I should be sure of replacing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
principal from the profits of my history, without indulging any
fanciful expectations from Aunt Hester, who complains a little
of your silence. *Thus much of this money transaction; to you
I need add no other stimulative, than to say that my ease and
comfort very much depend on the success of this plan.*</p>

<p>I have now opened your letter; send them to the Devil if they
talk of their moneys lying dead. Have I not been saddled with
the interest of my mortgage? From whom has the delay proceeded?
did <em>they</em> not insist on sending the deeds to Lausanne?
Have <em>I</em> not returned them with uncommon diligence? Since
Hugonin will not write to me himself, I must press and conjure
him through you to get the rents paid on or before the 1st
of December. I know not what may be this College business, but
am glad to hear no more of the scruples of the Chief tenant.
Cannot Hug. pick me up some odd money from Wooddyer?</p>

<p>On folding my Epistle, it turned out so minute that a cover
became decent, and you will expect a few lines for your additional
postage. First of <em>me</em>. I cannot esteem myself totally foolish
when I reflect on the success of a scheme executed in opposition
to the wisest of my friends. I have now given this place a year's
tryal, and find that the climate agrees with my health, (I have
not had a single return of the gout) and the people, their manners,
their way of life, are suited to my Genius: some rubs will intervene,
and even in my domestic life neither Deyverdun nor myself
are Angels, but on the whole, I shall number <em>this</em> among, or
rather above, the Happiest of my years, and nothing but your
salutary hand to clear and establish my pecuniary concerns is
now wanting.</p>

<p>*As I thought every man of sense and fortune in Ireland must
be satisfied, I did not conceive the cloud so dark as you represent
it.* If the growth of the Papists could awaken the fears and
prejudices of the Protestants, it might be lucky, and the discovery
of French gold would do more good than mischief. *I will
seriously peruse the 8<sup>o</sup>, and in due time the 4<sup>o</sup> Edition; it
would become a Classic book, if you could find leisure (will you
ever find it?) to introduce some kind of order and ornament.
You must negotiate <em>directly</em> with Deyverdun; but the State
will not hear of parting with their only Reynolds.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> I embrace

fiery spirit, and firm judgment, I almost wish you there; not for
your benefit, but for the public. If you resolve to recover your

<h2>497.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lady Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, October 22nd, 1784.
</p>

<p>*A few weeks ago, as I was walking on our Terrace with Mr.
Tissot, the celebrated Physician, Mr. Mercier, the author of the
Tableau de Paris; the Abbé Raynal, Mr., Madame, and Mademoiselle
Necker,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the Abbé de Bourbon, a natural son of Lewis
the fifteenth, the hereditary prince of Brunswick, Prince Henry
of Prussia, and a dozen Counts, Barons, and extraordinary persons,
among whom was a natural son of the Empress of Russia&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Are you satisfied with this list? which I could enlarge and
embellish, without departing from truth; and was not the Baron
of Sheffield (profound as he is on the subject of the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
trade) doubly mistaken with regard to Gibbon and Lausanne?
Whenever I used to hint my design of retiring, that illustrious
Baron, after a proper effusion of damned fools, condescended to
observe, that such an obscure nook in Switzerland might please
me in the ignorance of youth, but that after tasting for so many
years the various society of Paris and London, I should soon be
tired with the dull and uniform round of a provincial town. In
the winter, Lausanne is indeed reduced to its native powers; but
during the summer, it is possibly, after Spa, one of the most
favourite places of general resort. The voyage of Switzerland,
the Alps, and the Glaciers, is become a fashion; Tissot attracts
the Invalids, especially from France; and a Colony of English
have taken up the habit of spending their winters at Nice, and
their summers in the Pays de Vaud. Such are the splendour and
variety of our summer Visitors; and <em>you</em> will agree with me more
readily than the Baron, when I say that this variety, instead of
being a merit, is, in my opinion, one of the very few objections
to the residence of Lausanne. After the dissipation of the winter,
I expected to have enjoyed, with more freedom and solitude,
myself, my friend, my books, and this delicious paradise; but
my position and character make me here a sort of a public
character, and oblige me to see and be seen. However, it is my
firm resolution for next summer to assume the independence of a
Philosopher, and to be visible only to the persons whom I like.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MDLLE. NECKER AND PRINCE HENRY OF PRUSSIA.</div>

<p>On that principle I should not, most assuredly, have avoided
the Neckers and Prince Henry. The former have purchased the
Barony of Copet near Geneva; and as the buildings were very
much out of repair, they passed this summer at a country-house
at the gates of Lausanne. They afford a new example, that
persons who have tasted of greatness, can seldom return with
pleasure to a private station. In the moments when we were
alone he conversed with me freely, and I believe truly, on the
subject of his administration and fall; and has opened several
passages of modern history, which would make a very good figure
in <em>the</em> American book. If they spent the summers at the Castle
of Copet, about nine leagues from hence, a fortnight's or three
weeks' visit would be a pleasant and healthful excursion; but,
alas! I fear there is little appearance of its being executed. <em>Her</em>
health is impaired by the agitation of her mind: instead of returning
to Paris, she is ordered to pass the winter in the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
provinces of France, and our last parting was solemn; as I very
much doubt whether I shall ever see her again. They have now
a very troublesome charge, which you will experience in a few
years&mdash;the disposal of a Baroness. Mademoiselle Necker, one of
the greatest heiresses in Europe, is now about eighteen&mdash;wild,
vain, but good-natured, and with a much larger provision of wit
than beauty; what encreases their difficulties is their Religious
obstinacy of marrying her only to a Protestant. It would be an
excellent opportunity for a young Englishman of a great name
and a fair reputation. Prince Henry must be a man of sense;
for he took more notice, and expressed more esteem for me, than
any body else. He is certainly (without touching his military
character) a very lively and entertaining companion. He talked
with freedom, and generally with contempt, of most of the princes
of Europe; with respect of the Empress of Russia; but never
mentioned the name of his brother, except once, when he hinted
that it was <em>he himself</em> that won the battle of Rosbach.</p>

<p>His nephew, and our nephew, the hereditary prince of Brunswick,
is here for his education, a soft and heavy piece of German dough.
Of the English, who have lived very much as a national colony,
you will like to hear of Mrs. Fraser and <em>one</em> more. Donna
Catherina pleases every body by the perfect simplicity of her
state of Nature, and I am glad to see that her giddyness is
often checked by a sad remembrance of the General. You know
she has had resolution to return from England (where she told
me she saw you) to Lausanne, for the sake of Miss Bristow, who
is in a very bad way, and in a few days they set off for Nice.
<em>The other</em> is the Eliza; she passed through Lausanne, in her road
from Italy to England; poorly in health, but still adorable, (nay,
do not frown!) and I enjoyed some delightful hours by her bedside.
She wrote me a line from Paris, but has not executed her
promise of visiting Lausanne in the month of October.</p>

<p>My pen has run much faster, and much farther, than I intended
on the subject of others; yet, in describing them, I have thrown
some light over myself and my situation. A Year, a very short
one, has now elapsed since my arrival at Lausanne; and after a
cool review of my sentiments, I can sincerely declare, that I have
never, during a single moment, repented of having executed my
<em>absurd</em> project of retiring to Lausanne. It is needless to dwell
on the fatigue, the hurry, the vexation which I must have felt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the narrow and dirty circle of English Politics. My present life
wants no foil, and shines by its own native light. The chosen
part of my library is now arrived, and arranged in a room full as
good as that in Bentinck Street, with this difference indeed, that
instead of looking on a stone Court, twelve feet square, I command,
from three windows of plate glass, an unbounded prospect
of many a league of vineyard, of fields, of wood, of lake, and of
mountains; a scene which Lord S. will tell you is superior to all
you can imagine. The climate, though severe in Winter, has
perfectly agreed with my constitution; and the year is accomplished
without any return of the gout. An excellent house, a
good table, a pleasant garden, are no contemptible ingredients
in human happiness. The general style of society hits my fancy;
I have cultivated a large and agreeable circle of acquaintance,
and am much deceived if I have not laid the foundations of two
or three more intimate and valuable connections; but their
names would be indifferent, and it would require pages, or rather
volumes, to describe their persons and characters.</p>

<p>With regard to my standing dish, my domestic friend, I
could not be much disappointed, after an intimacy of eight
and twenty years. His heart and his head are excellent; he has
the warmest attachment for me, he is satisfied that I have the
same for him: some slight imperfections must be mutually
supported; two batchelors, who have lived so long alone and
independent, have their peculiar fancies and humours, and when
the mask of form and ceremony is laid aside, every moment in
a family life has not the sweetness of the honey moon, even
between the husbands and wives who have the truest and most
tender regard for each other.</p>

<p>Should you be very much surprized to hear of my being married?
Amazing as it may seem, I do assure you that the event is less
improbable than it would have appeared to myself a twelfthmonth
ago. Deyverdun and I have often agreed, in jest and in
earnest, that a house like ours would be regulated, and graced,
and enlivened, by an agreeable female Companion; but each of
us seems desirous that his friend should sacrifice himself for the
public good. Since my residence here I have lived much in
women's company; and, to your credit be it spoken, I like you
better the more I see of you. Not that I am in love with any
particular person. I have discovered about half a dozen <em>Wives</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
who would please me in different ways, and by various merits:
one as a Mistress (a Widow, vastly like <em>the</em> Eliza: if she returns
I am to bring them together); a second, a lively entertaining
acquaintance; a third, a sincere good-natured friend; a fourth,
who would represent with grace and dignity at the head of my
table and family; a fifth, an excellent economist and housekeeper;
and a sixth, a very useful nurse. Could I find all these qualities
united in a single person, I should dare to make my addresses,
and should deserve to be refused.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LOSS OF HIS VALET.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile I have experienced a separation from a more
humble companion with whom I expected to pass the remainder
of my life: in a few days Caplin departs for England. He had
long complained of his health, and though he made some progress
in French, he could not reconcile himself to the people and country,
and his personal attachment to me was less forcible than gratitude
perhaps would have required. As he has saved some money in
my service he proposes to set up in London in the Upholstery
business, and will be a very useful correspondent, as he has been
a very able assistant here in my first arrangements. I shall advise
him to go down to Sheffield, and you may question him about a
thousand little particulars. It is an heavy loss, yet I have the
good luck to procure in his place a Valet de Chambre, a man of
substance and reputation of this Country, but who has lived some
years at Paris: he has passed three months in the school of Caplin,
and as I am assured of his honesty and diligence I have very good
hopes of his address and intelligence.</p>

<p>*You hint in some of your letters, or rather postscripts, that
you consider me as having renounced England, and having fixed
myself for the rest of my life in Switzerland, and that you suspect
the sincerity of any vague or insidious schemes of purchase or
return. To remove, as far as I can, your doubts and suspicions,
I will tell you, on that interesting subject, fairly and simply as much
as I know of my own intentions. There is little appearance that I
shall be suddenly recalled by offer of a place or pension. I have
no claim to the friendship of your young Minister, and should he
propose a Commissioner of the Customs, or Secretary at Paris, the
former objects of my low ambition, Adam in Paradise would refuse
them with contempt. <em>Here</em> therefore I shall certainly live till I
have finished the remainder of my history; an arduous work,
which does not proceed so fast as I expected amidst the avocations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of Society, and miscellaneous Study. As soon as it is compleated,
most probably in three or <em>four</em> years, I shall infallibly return to
England, about the month of May or June; and the necessary
labour of printing with care two or three quarto Volumes, will
detain me till their publication, in the ensuing Spring. Lord
Sheffield and yourself will be the loadstone that most forcibly
attracts me; and as I shall be a vagabond on the face of the
earth, I shall be the better qualified to domesticate myself with
you, both in town and country. Here, then, at no very extravagant
distance, we have the certainty (if we live) of spending a
year together, in the peace and freedom of a friendly interest;
and a year is no very contemptible portion of this mortal existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS INVITATION TO THE SHEFFIELDS.</div>

<p>Beyond that period (I mean of the year, not of the existence,
though it be true enough of that likewise) all is dark, but not
gloomy. Whether, after the final completion of my history, I
shall return to Lausanne, or settle in England, must depend on a
thousand events which lye beyond the reach of human foresight,
the state of public and private affairs, my own health, the health
and life of Deyverdun, the fate of two elderly Ladies, the various
changes which may have rendered Lausanne more dear, or less
agreeable, to me than at present. But without losing ourselves
in this distant futurity, which perhaps we may never see, and
without giving any positive answer to Maria's parting question,
whether I should be buried in England or Switzerland, let me
seriously and earnestly ask you, whether you do not mean to visit
me next summer? The defeat at Coventry would, I should think,
facilitate the project; since the Baron is no longer detained the
whole winter from his domestic affairs, nor is there any attendance
on the house that keeps him till Midsummer in dust and
dispute. I can send you a pleasant route, through Normandy,
Paris, and Lyons, a visit to the Glaciers, and your return down
the Rhine, which would be commodiously executed in three or
four months, at no very extravagant expence, and would be
productive of health and spirits to you, of entertainment to you
both, and of instruction to the Baronessa. Without the smallest
inconvenience to myself, I am able to lodge Yourselves and family,
by arranging you in the winter apartment, which in the summer
season is not of any use to us. I think you will be satisfied with
your habitation, and already see you in your dressing-room; a
small but pleasant room, with a delightful prospect to the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and South. If poor Aunt Kitty (you oblige me beyond expression
by your tender care of that excellent Woman) if she were
only ten years younger, I would desire you to take her with you,
but I much fear we shall never meet again.</p>

<p>You will not complain of the brevity of this Epistle; I expect,
in return, a full and fair account of yourself, your thoughts and
actions, soul and body, present and future, in the safe, though
unreserved, confidence of friendship. The Baron in two words
hinted but an indifferent account of your health; you are a fine
machine; but as he was absent in Ireland, I hope I understand
the cause and the remedy. Next to yourself, I want to hear of
the two Baronesses. You must give me a faithful picture (and
though a mother you can give it) of their present external and
internal forms; for a year has now elapsed, and in <em>their</em> lives a year
is an age.* Has the gentle Louisa (though you had discovered
some marks of fire) expanded as much as you could expect in knowledge
and understanding? I see Maria an accomplished and elegant
young Woman, and only wish to know whether you have smoothed
away some of the asperities of that fine diamond. Adieu.</p>

<p>Remember me to Miss Firth: My Wedgewood's China. But
Caplin will put everything in motion.</p>

<p class="signature">
Ever yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">E. Gibbon</span>.
</p>

<p>I hear from Mrs. Frazer but an indifferent account of Mrs.
Holroyd of Bath. I want to have a <em>cool</em> and faithful state of
Mrs. G., her health and spirits: our correspondence is languid,
but indeed it is rather her fault than mine.</p>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, October 27th, 1784.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>If ever the excuse of procrastination be allowable it is
when we ourselves are expecting a letter to which we are entitled
in the due course of correspondence. Not that among friends
the cold ideas of form and duty of debt and payment call find
any admittance; but that every post that approaches and flyes
away, seems to mark and postpone the natural opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
writing by alternately raising and disappointing our hopes. I
am not indeed either surprized or angry at your long silence; the
correspondence of distant friends will inevitably languish without
any diminution of their mutual affection: their sentiments are
still the same but their ideas become different; they no longer
think or read or converse or act in the same sphere, and the
object of their intercourse will be at last reduced to the reciprocal
desire of being informed of each other's health and happiness.
Could we persuade ourselves to convey that information every
week or month in a billet of four lines, each friend would be
satisfied: but the distance seems to require a longer Epistle, and
the obligation of writing a great deal prevents us from writing
at all, and leaves our friend in the doubt (which I now most
anxiously feel) whether that silence be not occasioned by the
want of health or spirits.</p>

<p>It is more particularly in a situation like ours that we are not
prompted to write by the agitation and variety of the scenes which
surround us. Nothing can be more uniform and tranquil than
your Bath Life, except it be that which I lead at Lausanne. A
regular alternative of Study and society carries away the hours
and days in a smooth and pleasant Revolution, and I have
scarcely commenced a month before I am astonished to find myself
at the end of it&mdash;a sure indication of a quiet and domestic state of
happiness. I am well satisfied with my union with a known and
tryed friend, though (such are the infirmities of human nature)
all our moments cannot partake of the Honey-moon. Among
the people of the Country I have found some, I have formed
many more Connections; their manners, their conversation, their
style of living are perfectly adapted to my taste, and the sameness
of the company is relieved in the Summer by a concourse of
strangers whom health or curiosity or fashion invite to consult
Tissot or to visit the Alps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TEMPERATE DIET AND EASY MIND.</div>

<p>As a kind of public character, a live Author, I am a little too
much exposed to visits and compliments, but I was much delighted
with the unexpected meeting of the Neckers. Tired of greatness
and ambition (a polite phrase for a disgraced minister), they
purchased an estate in Switzerland, and while the Castle was
repairing they passed the summer in a country-house near Lausanne.
Their society might diversify my life with occasional excursions;
but, alas! <em>her</em> health is very much affected, and I think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
extremely doubtful whether she will be able to revisit this country
again. Of myself I can give you a much more pleasing account,
nor do I remember a year in which I have enjoyed a more perfect
state of health; the air though sharp is pure; it may be dangerous
for weak lungs, but is excellently suited to a gouty constitution,
and during the whole twelfth month I have never once been
attacked by my old Enemy. Of Dr. Cadogan's three rules, I
can observe two, a temperate diet and a easy mind. I am not
agitated by the hopes and fears, and <em>regrets</em> of my London life,
and whatever cares still pursue and overtake me are blown over
by an English wind. I am afraid you sometimes sigh over me
as an Exile. If I were fixed as a foreign Minister at Naples, or
Petersburgh, you would be reconciled to my situation, yet such a
splendid situation would be corroded by many a secret anxiety,
and content is surely preferable to greatness. Adieu, My Dear
Madam; give me a <em>satisfactory line</em>, and ever believe me,</p>

<h2>499.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, March 13th, 1785.
</p>

<p>*My long silence (and it has been long) must not, on this
occasion, be imputed to lazyness, though that little Devil may
likewise have been busy. But you cannot forget how many
weeks I remained in suspence, expecting every post the final
sentence, and not knowing what to say in that passive uncertainty.
It is now something more than a fortnight since your last letter,
and that of Gosling informed me of the event. I have intended
every day to write, and every day I have started back with reluctance
and disgust, from the consideration of the wretched subject.
Lenborough irrecoverably gone, for three-fourths of its real, at
least of its ancient, Value; my seat in Parliament (for the
subject now presses home upon me) sunk without the smallest
equivalent in the abyss of your cursed politics, and a balance
neatly cyphered and summed by Gosling, which shews me a very
shallow purse, in which others have a clearer right to dip than
myself.</p>


<p class="head"><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
March 21st.
</p>

<p>Another week has now elapsed, and though nothing is changed
in this too faithful state of my affairs, I feel myself able to
encounter them with more spirit and resolution; to look on the
future, rather than the past; on the fair, rather than on the foul
side of the prospect. I shall speak in the confidence of friendship,
and while you listen to the more doleful tale of my wants
and wishes, You will have the satisfaction of hearing some
circumstances in my present situation of a less unpleasing nature.</p>

<p>1. In the first place, I most heartily rejoyce in the sale, however
unfavourable, of the Bucks Estate. Considering the dullness
of the times, and the high interest of money, it is not a little to
obtain even a tolerable price, and I am sensible how much your
patience and industry have been exercised to extort the payment*
from a knavish or obstinate purchaser. Without supposing a
shilling of balance in Gosling's hands, my circumstances are improved
by the sale to the annual amount of £150; of £50 which I
was obliged to add for the interest of the mortgage, of £100 which
I received from my French annuity.</p>

<p>*2. Your resistance to my Swiss expedition was more friendly
than wise. Had I yielded, after eighteen months of suspense and
anxiety, I should now, a still poorer man, be driven to embrace the
same resource, which has succeeded according to, or even beyond,
my most sanguine expectation. I do not pretend to have discovered
the terrestrial paradise, which has not been known in this
World since the fall of Adam; but I can truly declare, (now the
charms of novelty are long since faded,) that I have found the plan
of life the best adapted to my temper and my situation. I am now
writing to you in a room as good as that in Bentinck Street, with
three large windows of plate glass which command the country, the
lake, and the mountains, and the opening prospect of the spring.
The aforesaid room is furnished without magnificence, but with
every conveniency for warmth, ease, and study, and the walls are
already covered with more than two thousand volumes, the choice
of a chosen library. I have health, friends, an amusing society,
and perfect freedom. (A Commissioner of the Excise! the idea
makes me sick).* Even in Trifles, though it is not a Trifle, I have
been singularly lucky, and you will conceive an high opinion of
Blondel, my new Valet de Chambre, when I assure you that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
except in the knowledge of books and the Upholstery business, I
no longer regret Caplen. He probably related all the minute
circumstances of my state, and I find, that without any prejudice
for the Country and people, he has not represented them in an
unfavourable light. *If you ask me what I have saved by my
retreat to Lausanne, I will fairly tell you (in the two great
articles of a Carriage and a house in town, and breathing place
at Hampton Court, both which were indispensable, and are now
annihilated, with the difference of Clubs, public places, servants'
wages, &amp;c.) about four hundred pounds, or Guineas, a year; no
inconsiderable sum, when it must be annually found as addition
to an expence which is somewhat larger than my present
revenue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS ESTABLISHMENT AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>3. <em>"What is then," you will ask, "my present establishment?"</em>
This is not by any means a cheap Country; and, except in the
article of wine, I could give a dinner or make a coat, perhaps for
the same price in London as at Lausanne. My chief advantage
arises from the things which I do not want; and in some
respects my style of living is enlarged by the encrease of my
relative importance&mdash;an obscure batchelor in England, the master
of a considerable house at Lausanne. Here I am expected to
return entertainments, to receive Ladies, &amp;c. and to perform
many duties of society, which, though agreeable enough in themselves,
contribute to inflame a Housekeeper's bills. From the
disbursements of the first year I cannot form any just estimate;
the extraordinary expences of the journey, carriage of heavy
goods from England, the acquisition of many books, which it
was not expedient to transport, the purchase of furniture, wine,
fitting up my library, and the irregularity of a new Ménage, have
consumed a pretty large sum. But in a quiet, prudent, regular
course of life, I think I can support myself with comfort and
honour for six or seven hundred pounds a year, instead of a
thousand or eleven hundred in England.* I can look forward
with strong and rational hope. The departure of the two
matrons, or not to build on the ice, the mere suppression of the
Bath jointure will give me more than that income, which may
even be enlarged by turning Buriton into an annuity.</p>

<p>*Besides these uncertainties, (uncertain at least as to the time,)
I have a sure and honourable supply from my own pen. I
continue my history with pleasure and assiduity; the way is long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and laborious, yet I see the end, and I can almost promise to land
in England next September twelfthmonth, with a Manuscript of
the current value of three thousand pounds, which will afford
either a small income or a large capital. It is in the meanwhile
that my situation is somewhat painful and difficult.* From
the French and English funds and the various produce on my
Copper share, I receive between two or three hundred pounds:
the rent of Buriton is between six and seven hundred, but when
you have deducted taxes, repairs, Mrs. G.'s jointure (£300 clear)
&amp;c., weigh the residue; it will not break down the scale. It
happens unluckily enough that this year there will be an extraordinary
deduction (at least one hundred guineas) of the fine
which is paid every seven years for the renewal of Horn farm.
Since my arrival here, I have never received a line from Hugonin,
to whom I wrote a long letter last summer, and I fear his eyes
and infirmities disqualify him a little for business. The sums
which he has remitted to Gosling the last and the present winter
fall below the most moderate computation, and I see no reason or
account of the deficiency. I wish you would write to him in my
name or your own, and make yourself master of that same part
of my affairs. Richard Andrews, an honest attorney of Petersfield,
is allowed my quitrents for holding my courts, and he
might surely, without more trouble or wages, receive and remit
the rents of three or four farms.</p>

<p>*Such are the services and revenues of the year; proceed we
now, in the style of the budget, to the ways and means of
extraordinary supplies.* Payne's valuation of the remaining
part of my library has not perfectly answered my expectation.
Yet it is approved by my friend, Elmsley, who offers on his
own account to change the pounds into Guineas, and as I want
the money, and esteem his integrity, I shall signify my acceptance
if he will allow me to make another moderate draft from the
Catalogue. That transaction (all accounts settled) will put
some money in my pocket: but as I understand that kind
of business I will not trouble you or myself with any farther
details. A circumstance which surprized me in Gosling's account
is the last six months from Lady day to Michaelmas last,
during which I pay interest for the Mortgage without receiving
rent from the Estate: surely that is not just or reasonable.
If that half year is properly excepted in the Conveyance, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
my omnipotent Attorney may draw it from the tenants, and it
will serve at least to discharge Harris's bond. If it is not, I
must submit with a sigh to this new deduction of two or three
hundred pounds from the poor price of poor Lenborough. But
this deficiency must somewhere be supplied: as I now pay interest
to the <em>Job</em> for my horses, I can make the man wait a Couple of
years till my return. But this cursed account of Newton! He
is pathetic, you say, on the score of money advanced; a draft for
£200 which I send you inclosed would surely discharge that
advance, and you will try to manage him to stay till my labours
are finished for the payment of his own. Yet perhaps the clearest
and most honourable way would be to borrow £500 of the Goslings
on my account and your own bond. *I will not affront your
friendship, by observing that you will incur little or no risk on
this occasion. Read, consider, act, and write.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PITT A FAVOURITE ABROAD.</div>

<p>It is the privilege of friendship to make our friend a patient
hearer, and active Associate in our own affairs; and I have now
written five pages on my private affairs, without saying a word
either of the public, or of yourself. Of the public I have little
to say; I never was a very warm Patriot, and I grow every day
a Citizen of the World. The scramble for power and profit at
Westminster or St. James's, and the names of Pitt and Fox,
become less interesting to me than those of Cæsar and Pompey.
You are not a friend of the young Minister, but he is a great
favourite on the Continent, as he appears to be still; and you
must own that the fairness of his character, his eloquence, his
application to business, and even his youth, must prepossess at
least the ignorant in his favour. Of the merit or defects of his
administration I cannot pretend to speak; but I find, from the
complaints of some interested persons, that his restraints on the
smuggling of tea have already ruined the East India Companies
of Antwerp and Sweden, and that even the Dutch will scarcely
find it worth their while to send any ships to China. Your Irish
friends appear to be more quiet, at least the Volunteers and
national Congress seem to subside. How far that tranquillity
must be purchased on our side, by any pernicious sacrifices, you
will best decide; and from some hints in your last letters, I am
inclined to think that you are less affected than might be supposed
with national or local prejudice. Your introduction I have
attentively read; the matter, though most important in itself, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
out of the line of my studies and habits, and the subordinate
beauties of style and arrangement you disclaim. Yet I can say
with truth, that I never met with more curious and diligent
investigation, more strong sense, more liberal spirit, and more
cool and impartial temper in the same number of pages.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>By this time you have probably read Necker's book on the
Finances. Perhaps for you there is too much French enthusiasm
and paint; but in many respects you must have gained a knowledge
of his country, and on the whole, you must have been pleased with
the picture of a great and benevolent mind. In your attack on
Deyverdun for my picture I cannot promise you much success;
he seems resolved to maintain his right of possession, and your
only chance would be a personal assault. The next summer
(how time slips away!) was fixed for your visit to Lausanne.
We are prepared at all points to receive <em>you</em>, My lady, and a
princess or two, with their train; and if you have a proper
contempt for St. Stephen's chappel, you are perfectly free, and
at leisure (can you ever be at leisure?) for the summer season.
As you are now in a great measure disengaged from my affairs,
you may find time to inform me of your proceedings and your
projects. At present I do not even know whether you pass the
winter at Sheffield-place or in Downing-street. My lady revenges
herself of my long silence. Yet I embrace her and the Infants.
In a few weeks we expect Miss Bristow and Mrs. Fraser from
Nice. Adieu. You have deranged the decline and fall this
morning. I have finished my Epistle since dinner, and am now
going to a pleasant party and good supper.*</p>

<p>I send you enclosed a promissory note for £500. If you do
not borrow the money of Gosling, you may throw it into the fire;
if you do, in case of death it will serve as a remembrance. You
will find that before and since the receipt of their balance I have
drawn this year for £300. The change is most amazingly in my
favour, and a banker of credit and substance at Lausanne allows
me 4 per Cent. for all the money I leave on his hands.</p>

<h2>500.</h2>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, July 15th, 1785.
</p>

<p>Indeed and indeed, my Dear Madam, I will never go to sleep
again; my next letter shall be short and speedy, and I will not
always put myself under the shameful necessity of employing the
first page in worthless Apologies. On the present occasion I will
not excuse myself by saying (what is true enough) that I waited
week after week in hopes of hearing from you. As our last letters
crossed each other, you might reasonably entertain the same
expectation, and thus it is that poor miserable mortals try to
provide a decent colour for their own lazyness. You will expect
some account of the time of silence, and that account will be
short and satisfactory. I am no longer in the illusions of the
Honey-moon, when every deformity is concealed, and a smooth
deceitful gloss is given to every object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A YOUNG MAN AT FIFTY.</div>

<p>In the space of two and twenty months, the Climate and
Society of Lausanne, my own situation and expence, the character
of my companion and of my looser connections of both sexes
are perfectly understood. The Climate in these two Winters
has shewn itself to all Europe, more strongly perhaps to us,
under the most hideous form, severe cold, and a continuance or
repetition of snow till the middle of April. In general my
health has perfectly sustained the rigour of the season; good
spirits, good appetite, good sleep are my habitual state, and
though verging towards fifty I still feel myself a young man.
I was in hopes that my old Enemy the Gout had given over the
attack, but the Villain, with his ally the winter, convinced me
of my error, and about the latter end of March I found myself
a prisoner in my library and my great chair. I attempted twice
to rise, he twice knocked me down again, and kept possession
of both my feet and knees longer (I must confess) than he
had ever done before. My recovery has been proportionably
tedious, and I am hardly yet in possession of my full strength;
this admonition calls for some extraordinary care, and without
running into sudden extremes, I consult both my reason and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
taste by abstaining at night from wine and meat, and contenting
myself with a bason of milk.</p>

<p>Such are the drawbacks on the comforts of life, yet I am
pleased to think that my gout, though it has adhered somewhat
longer than usual, is neither sharp nor frequent, and respectfully
confines itself to the lower extremities of the Machine. Of the
Country I must not complain, this dry Climate is particularly
favourable to gouty constitutions; Dr. Tissot and my own observation
inform me that it is rare among the natives, and among
my acquaintance I can only name one old Gentleman, who by
free living acquired it about the age of three score. My unpleasant
and sometimes painful confinement was soothed not
only by the mercenary aid of Servants and Physicians (the
fee of a visit is about half a crown), but by the assiduous offices
of my friends, and instead of the lonesome time an invalid who
has not a family must pass amidst the crowds of London, I had
the frequent visits of agreable men and women and a party of
cards every evening that I chose it.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that real affection, especially to a stranger,
is a very plentiful commodity, but here there are much fewer
avocations of business or pleasure, and my style of living, my
house, my table, &amp;c., make me a man of mark and consequence.
With the recovery of my strength, I now return civilities, relax
my studies, and visit my acquaintance who are not gone; but so
well do I like this habitation, and such is my sedentary disposition,
that I have not yet lain from Home, nor gone five miles from
Lausanne. You will give me credit when I say, that, though a
lover of society, my library is the room to which I am the most
attached. I almost hesitate whether I shall tell you that the
prospect and furniture are equally agreable, that a reasonable
number of my books is arrived from England, and that my whole
establishment is formed upon a comfortable yet &oelig;conomical plan:
in the single articles of house-rent, carriage, servants' wages,
clubs, and public places I save between four and five hundred a
year. And let me appeal to your reason and spirit whether such
a saving be not as real and a much more honourable addition
of income, than a pityful, precarious place or pension to be held
or lost by the caprice of a Minister or the Revolutions of politics.
When I was flattered with a <em>distant</em> hope of a seat at the boards
of customs or excise, I was told that I need not work above five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
days in the week, and that I should sometimes enjoy the respite
of Holydays and Vacations. Without any attendance or obligation
I have given myself a state of leisure and independence, in which
my labour is only employed on litterary pursuits, the objects of
my choice and the foundation of my fame.</p>

<p>As every white spot in this life is clouded with a shade of black,
I can only lament that this state is so far remote from the best
and most faithful of my friends, so faithful and so true that they
will enjoy my happiness though they cannot be witnesses or partakers
of it. On my side, I think <em>of</em> them much oftener than I
write <em>to</em> them, and warmly cherish the hope of an English Journey
to them; the time must depend on the completion of my history,
and I am sorry to observe that as I advance on my Journey
"New Alps on Alps arise;" and I know not when I shall reach
the shelter of my Inn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGES IN ENGLISH POLITICS.</div>

<p>After yourself and Mrs. Porten, Lord and Lady Sheffield are
the persons whom I most desire to see. Among my companions
of the World are undoubtedly several whom I regard and of whose
good wishes I am persuaded; yet those slighter tyes are insensibly
relaxed by the distance of time and place, by the interposition
of new objects. My political connections have undergone such
astonishing changes, a new Parliament, a new Administration,
Patriots whom I left Ministers, Ministers whom I left Boys, the
whole Map of the Country so totally altered, that I sometimes
imagine I have been ten years absent from England. That
incessant hurry of Politicks was indeed one of the things which
disgusted the most, and there is nothing pleases me so much in
this country as to enjoy all the blessings of a Good Government
without ever talking or thinking of our Governors. In my
domestic Government a great though not unexpected Revolution
has happened. Caplen, unable to accustom himself to the language
or manners of this country, resigned his employments and returned
to England the beginning of last winter. You may easily conceive
my loss and apprehension, and you will rejoyce in my good
fortune that I was able to fill his place with no unworthy successor;
a servant of this country, but who had lived with a Lady
at Paris till her death&mdash;a man of substance and reputation, and
who on the tryal of some months appears to deserve my confidence
and good opinion. We are already thoroughly accustomed to
each other. Adieu. My Dear Madam, may our correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be more frequent, and may I find you on my return in the
possession of every blessing.</p>

<p class="signature">
Most truly yours,<br />

<h2>501.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, September 5th, 1785.
</p>

<p>*Extract from a weekly English paper, September 5th, 1785.&mdash;"It
is reported, but we hope without foundation, that the celebrated
Mr. Gibbon, who had retired to Lausanne in Switzerland
to finish his valuable history, lately died in that city."</p>

<p>The hope of the News writer is very handsome and obliging to
the historian; yet there are several weighty reasons which would
incline me to believe that the intelligence may be true. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primo</i>,
It must one day be true; and therefore may very probably be so
at present. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Secundo</i>, We may always depend on the impartiality,
accuracy, and veracity of an English newspaper. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tertio</i>, which is
indeed the strongest argument, we are credibly informed that for
a long time past the said celebrated historian has not written to
any of his friends in England; and as that respectable personnage
had always the reputation of a most exact and regular correspondent,
it may be fairly concluded from his silence, that he either
is, or ought to be, dead. The only objection that I can foresee,
is the assurance that Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; himself read the article as he
was eating his breakfast, and laughed very heartily at the mistake
of his brother historian; but as he might be desirous of concealing
that unpleasant event, we shall not insist on his apparent
health and spirits, which might be affected by that subtle
politician. He affirms, however, not only that he is alive, and
was so on the fifth of September, but that his head, his heart, his
stomach, are in the most perfect state, and that the Climate of
Lausanne has been congenial both to his mind and body. He
confesses, indeed, that after the last severe winter, the Gout, his
old enemy, from whom he hoped to have escaped, pursued him to
his retreat among the mountains of Helvetia, and that the siege
was long, though more languid than in his precedent attacks;
after some exercise of patience he began to creep, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to walk; and though he can neither run, nor fly, nor dance, he
supports himself with grace and firmness on his two legs, and
would willingly kick the impertinent Gazetteer; impertinent
enough, though more easily to be forgiven than the insolent
Courier du Bas Rhin, who about three years ago amused himself
and his readers with a fictitious Epistle from Mr. Gibbon to Dr.
Robertson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CURIOUS QUESTION OF PHILOSOPHY.</div>

<p>Perhaps now you think, Irish Baron, that I shall apologize in
humble style for my silence and neglect. But, on the contrary,
I do assure you that I am truly provoked at your Lordship's not
condescending to be in a passion. I might really have been dead,
I might have been sick; if I were neither dead nor sick, I
deserved a volley of curses and reproaches for my infernal
laziness, and you have defrauded me of my just dues. Had I
been silent till Christmas, till Doomsday, you would never have
thought it worth your while to abuse me. "Why, then," (let
me ask in your name and language, 'you damned beast'), "did you
not write before?" That is indeed a very curious question of
natural and moral Philosophy. Certainly I am not lazy; elaborate
quartos have proved, and will abundantly prove my diligence. I
<em>can</em> write; spare my modesty on that subject. I like to converse
with my friends by pen or tongue, and as soon as I can set myself
a going, I know no moments that run off more pleasantly. I am
so well convinced of that truth, and so much ashamed of forcing
people that I love to forget me, that I have now resolved to set
apart the first hour of each day for the discharge of my obligations;
beginning <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme de raison</i>, with yourself, and regularly
proceeding to Lord Loughborough and the rest. May Heaven
give me strength and grace to accomplish this laudable intention!
Amen.</p>

<p>Certainly (yet I do not know whether it be so certain) I
should write much oftener to you, if we were not linked in
business, and if my business had not always been of the unpleasant
and mortifying kind. Even now I shove the ugly monster to
the end of this epistle, and will confine him to a page by himself,
that he may not infect the purer air of our correspondence. Of
my situation here I have little new to say, except a very comfortable
and singular truth, that my passion for my wife or
mistress (Fanny Lausanne) is not palled by satiety and possession
of two years. I have seen her in all seasons and in all humours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and though she is not without faults, they are infinitely over-balanced
by her good qualities. Her face is not handsome, but
her person, and every thing about her, has admirable grace and
beauty: she is of a very chearful, sociable temper; without much
learning, she is endowed with taste and good sense; and though
not rich, the simplicity of her education makes her a very good
economist; she is forbid by her parents to wear any expensive
finery; and though her limbs are not much calculated for walking,
she has not yet asked me to keep her a Coach.</p>

<p>Last spring (not to wear the metaphor to rags) I saw
Lausanne in a new light, during my long fit of the Gout;
and must boldly declare, that either in health or sickness I
find it far more comfortable than your huge metropolis. In
London my confinement was sad and solitary; the many forgot
my existence when they saw me no longer at Brookes's; and
the few, who sometimes cast a thought or an eye on their
friend, were detained by business or pleasure, the distance of
the way, or the hours of the house of commons; and I was
proud and happy if I could prevail on Elmsley to enliven the
dullness of the Evening. Here the objects are nearer, and
more distinct, and I myself am an object of much larger magnitude.
People are not kinder, but they are more idle, and it must
be confessed that, of all nations on the globe, the English
are the least attentive to the old and infirm; I do not mean
in acts of charity, but in the offices of civil life. During three
months I have had round my chair a succession of agreeable
men and women, who came with a smile, and vanished at a nod;
and as soon as it was agreeable I had a constant party at cards,
which was sometimes dismissed to their respective homes, and
sometimes detained by Deyverdun to supper, without the least
trouble or inconvenience to myself. In a word, my plan has
most compleatly answered; and I solemnly protest, after two
years' tryal, that I have never in a single moment repented of my
transmigration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS COUNTRYMEN AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>The only disagreeable circumstance is the encrease of a
race of animals with which this country has been long infested,
and who are said to come from an island in the Northern
Ocean. I am told, but it seems incredible, that upwards of
40,000 English, masters and servants, are now absent on the
continent; and I am sure we have our full proportion, both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
town and country, from the month of June to that of October.
The occupations of the Closet, indifferent health, want of horses,
in some measure plead my excuse; yet I do too much to
please myself, and probably too little to satisfy my Countrymen.
What is still more unlucky is, that a part of the Colony of this
present year are really good company, people one knows, &amp;c.;
the Astons,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Hales, Hampdens, Trevors,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Lady Clarges<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and
Miss Carter (<em>her Sappho</em>), Lord Northington,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> &amp;c. I have
seen Trevor several times, who talks of you, and seems to be a
more exact correspondent than myself. <em>His wife</em> is much improved
by her diplomatic life, and shines in every company, as a
woman of fashion and elegance. But those who have repaid me
for the rest were Lord and Lady Spencer.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> I saw them almost
every day, at my house or their own, during their stay of a
month; for they were hastening to Italy, that they might return
to London next February. He is a valuable man, and where he
is familiar, a pleasant Companion; she a charming woman, who,
with sense and spirit, has the simplicity and playfulness of a
child. You are not ignorant of her talents, of which she has left
me an agreable specimen, a drawing of the Historic muse, sitting
in a thoughtful posture to compose.</p>

<p>So much of self and Co. Let us now talk a little of your
house and your two Countries. Does my Lady ever join in
the abuse which I have merited from you? Is she satisfied
with her own behaviour, her unpardonable silence, to one of
the prettiest, most obliging, most entertaining, most &amp;c. Epistles
that ever was penned since the Epistles of Paul of Tarsus?
Will she not <em>mew</em> one word of reply? I want some account of
her spirits, health, amusements, of the womanly accomplishments
of Maria, and the opening graces of Louisa: of yourself
I wish to have some of those details which she is much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
likely to transmit. Are you patient in your exclusion from
the House? Are you satisfied with legislating with your pen?
Do you pass the whole winter in town? Have you resumed the
pursuits of farming, &amp;c.? What new connexions, public or
private, have you formed? A tour to the Continent would be
the best medicine for the shattered nerves of a soldier and
politician. By this expression you will perceive that your letter
to Deyverdun is received; it landed last post, after I had already
written the two first pages of this composition. On the whole,
my friend was pleased and flattered: but instead of surrendering
or capitulating, he seems to be making preparations for an
obstinate defence. He already talks of the right of possession,
of the duties of a good Citizen, of a writ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne exeat Regno</i>, and of
a vote of the two hundred, that whosoever shall, directly or
indirectly, &amp;c., is an Enemy to his Country. Between you be the
strife, while I sit with my scales in my hand, like Jupiter on
Mount Ida.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SENSE OR NONSENSE OF IRISH PARLIAMENTS.</div>

<p>I begin to view with the same indifference the combat
of Achilles Pitt and Hector Fox; for such as it should now
seem, must be the comparison of the two Warriors.* Lord
Northington, who is firm in his party, assures me that the
popularity of the young Minister, and even the opinion of his
abilities, have considerably diminished; but he confesses that
such, or much greater, diminution will not weaken his influence in
the Parliament, and must tend to promote his favour and confidence
in a certain place. *At this distance I am much less
angry with bills, taxes, and propositions, than I am pleased with
Pitt for making a friend and a deserving man happy, for releasing
poor Batt from the shackles of the law, and for enhancing the
gift of a secure and honourable competency, by the handsome
unsolicited manner in which it was conferred. This I understand
to be the case, from the unsuspicious evidence of Lord N.
and Chief Baron Skinner; and if I can find time (<em>resolution</em>) I
will send him a hearty congratulation; if I fail, you may at least
communicate my intentions. Of Ireland I know nothing, and
while I am Writing the decline of a great Empire, I have not
leisure to attend to the affairs of a remote and petty province. I
see that your friend Foster<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> has been hooted by the Mob, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
unanimously chosen Speaker by the House of Commons. How
could Pitt expose himself to the disgrace of withdrawing his
propositions after a public attempt?<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Have ministers no way of
computing beforehand the sense or nonsense of an Irish parliament?
I am quite in the dark; your pamphlet, or book, would
probably have opened my eyes; but whatever may have been the
reason, I give you <em>my word of honour</em> that I have never seen nor
heard of it. Here we are much more engaged with Continental
politics. In general we hate the emperor,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> as the enemy of peace,
without daring to make War. The old Lyon of Prussia<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> acts a
much more glorious part, as the Champion of public tranquillity,
and the independence of the German states.</p>

<p>And now for the bitter and nauseous pill of pecuniary
business, upon which I shall be as concise as possible in the two
articles of my discourse, land and money.* And concise indeed I
may be according to the slender proportion of either that is now
left. You sometimes accuse me of not reading or remembering
the most important points of your despatches: may I not equally
complain that you pass in silence all my enquiries and requests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on the subject of Buriton? In the space of two years I have
never received a line of intelligence from Hugonin concerning
the state of that last and dearest possession. And as far as I can
judge from Gosling's confused account, which records only dates
and names, a portion, not a very small one, of the rent remains
unpaid, or has been sunk in unknown charges and expences.
Let me therefore repeat perhaps more clearly what I have already
desired.</p>

<p>1. That you would correspond with Hugonin, and obtain from
him a correct mercantile account of debtor and creditor of rents
and payments for the aforesaid two years.</p>

<p>2. That if there remains any arrears, you would propose and
enforce the most vigorous measures for my prompt and entire
satisfaction.</p>

<p>3. That as there must be deducted from this year's rents a
considerable fine to Magdalen College for Horn, Hugonin at your
instigation would cast about to see whether he cannot perceive
any extraordinary means of supply in the timber way. A dozen
years have now elapsed since the first Cut of the Hanger. May
not those <em>underwoods</em> be again ripe for the Axe? You know I
consider only present profit, and disregard all future improvements
and rural beauty. A beast, you will say. Alas, why do
hard circumstances force me to be one?</p>

<p>4. That you would manage, if it can be done without <em>offence</em>
or expence, the substitution of Richard Andrews, in the place of
Hugonin, a clear-sighted Agent for a blind Gentleman. I fear
nothing more is to be expected from Lenborough, but as you
seem quiet, I entertain a faint hope that Harris's bond has been
discharged from the rent or purchase money. You have done no
more than I expected in assuring me that the £500 shall be
ready at Goslings', but I should be sorry to distress you, or to lay
your generous spirit under any obligations to a purse-proud Cit.
If they will readily take your bond, and allow me credit for the
sum before the 1st of December for January next, it will be the
readiest and most private way. Otherwise I can have recourse
to another expedient, of desiring the Darrels either to sell an
equivalent part of my short annuity, or, if the funds are too low,
to advance me the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">desideratum</i> on a security which is in their
own hands. When I am possessed of the money in one way or
another I will take a view of my former credit with Gosling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
(a small credit, I trow) of this additional supply of my debts,
expences, and resources, and I hope I shall be able to discharge at
least the remainder of Newton's bill. But I must not impoverish
myself too, and I have some thoughts of keeping the rest of my
library (if not troublesome to Downing Street) till my return to
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DELAYS IN HIS HISTORY.</div>

<p>*It is impossible to hate more than I do this odious necessity
of owing, borrowing, anticipating; and I look forwards with
impatience to the happy period when the supplies will always
be raised within the year, with a decent and useful surplus in
the treasury. Had it not been for the cursed dissolution of
Parliament, such would already have been the case. I now trust
to the conclusion of my History, and it will hasten and secure
the principal comforts of my life. You will believe I am not
lazy; yet I fear the term is somewhat more distant than I
thought. My long gout lost me three months in the spring; in
every great work unforeseen [obstacles], and difficulties, and
delays will arise; and I should be rather sorry than surprized
if next autumn was postponed to the ensuing spring. If My
Lady (a good creature) should write to Mrs. Porten, she may
convey news of my life and health, without saying anything of
this <em>possible</em> delay. Adieu. I embrace, &amp;c.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, January 17th, 1786.
</p>

<p>*Hear all Ye nations! An Epistle from Sheffield-place, received
the 17th of January, is answered the same day; and to say the
truth, this method, which is the best, is at the same time the most
easy and pleasant. Yet I do not allow that in the last past silence
and delay you have any more right to damn than myself. Our
letters crossed each other, our claims were equal, and if both had
been stiffly maintained, our mutual silence must have continued
till the day of judgment. The balance was doubtless in my
favour, if you recollect the length, the fullness, the variety of
pleasant and instructive matter of my last dispatch. Even at
present, of myself, my occupations, my designs, I have little or
nothing to add; and can only speak dryly and briefly to very dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and disagreeable business demands and want of money. But we
shall both agree that the true criminal is My Lady; and though
I do suppose that a letter is on the road, which will make some
amends, her obstinate, contumacious, dilatory silence, after so
many months or years since my valuable letter, is worthy not of
a Cat but of a Royal Tygress.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding your gloomy politicians, I do love the
funds; and were the next war to reduce them to half, the
remainder would be a better and pleasanter property, than a
similar value in your dirty acres. We are now in the height
of our winter amusements; balls, great suppers, comedies, &amp;c.;
and, except St. Stephen's, I certainly lead a more gay and
dissipated life here, among the Alps, (by the bye, a most extraordinary
mild winter,) than in the midst of London. Yet
my mornings, and sometimes an afternoon, are diligently employed,
my work advances, but much remains, indeed much more
than I imagined; but a great book, like a great house, was never
yet finished at the given time. When I talk of the spring of '87,
I suppose all my time well bestowed; and what do you think of
a fit of the gout, that may disqualify me for two or three months?
You may growl, but if you calmly reflect on my pecuniary and
sentimental state, you will believe that I most earnestly desire to
compleat my labour, and <em>visit</em> England. Adieu.*</p>

<p>With regard to the three old Ladies, I behave like a fool to
one, and like a beast (though they too are silent) to the other two.
But all shall be speedily rectified. The portrait seems to be firmly
rooted here. You know you have no right, and Deyverdun seems
not disposed to shew you any indulgence.</p>

<p class="signature">
Yours,<br />
E. G.
</p>

<p>I shall probably hear from you and the Goslings before the
end of next month, and you may depend on an immediate answer.
You will probably have corresponded with Hugonin. It is surely
hard to be obliged to a man, who in two years and four months,
has not condescended to send me a line of information or account.
If you talk of credit, you must allow that it is unpleasant to desire
the Darrels to sell a part of my short Annuity.</p>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 3rd, 1786.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>Shall I begin by a complaint or an apology? Without
much injustice I might complain of your long silence, which
between other correspondents than ourselves might seem to
indicate some degree of forgetfulness, the too frequent consequences
of absence and distance. Between us, however, it indicates
no such thing, and in the confidence of our mutual regard our
silence is more eloquent than the loquacity of others. I might
even add that the constant expectation on every post-day of
a letter from Bath, has suspended my not very vigorous efforts to
renew the correspondence. Some truth there undoubtedly may
be in this assertion, but you will much more readily believe, that
in my strange compound of industry and lazyness, I have very
often formed the design, and as often found some excellent reason
of delay till the very next post, when I would most undoubtedly
write to the best and dearest of my friends. Perhaps it would
not be a bad method on both sides, a note of four lines, a certificate
of health and remembrance, without computing of debtor
or creditor, or any formal attempt to produce a regular Epistle.
But as even this project may fail, I must seriously beg that you
would never allow yourself to be made uneasy by any flying
reports, or newspaper. Be assured that if any untoward accident
should stop my breath, or disable my hand, my friend M. Deyverdun
will send the early and authentic Gazette to Sheffield place, from
whence it will be imparted with proper speed to my other friends
in England. At the same time, I can affirm with truth, that my
sole reason for this advertisement is derived from some foolish
Articles, that were very familiar last year to the home and foreign
papers. Since I have known you or myself I never had more
pleasing inducements to cherish life, or less apprehension of too
speedily quitting it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPROVEMENT IN HIS HEALTH.</div>

<p>My health is certainly better than when I left England, and
this improvement I partly ascribe to the climate, and partly to the
temperance of my diet. I had long ago shaken off the bad habits
of the Hampshire Militia, but a London life, in the best Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
is a life of fullness and intemperance; which cannot be separated
from the lateness and irregularity of our hours, the variety of
wines and dishes, and the English practise of setting after dinner,
with the bottle and glasses on the table. Since my last fit of
the Gout, I avoid the temptation without losing the pleasure of
suppers, by confining myself to a mess of boiled milk, and in
companies of twenty or thirty men and women, my frugal bason
has often been placed on the tables: my dinners are moderate,
and breakfast still continues to be my favourite repast. This
regimen appears to have succeeded; I have passed the winter
without hearing of the enemy, and last month, after a short and
slight visit or rather menace, he politely retired, and has left me
free to enjoy the beauties of an incomparable spring, which rapidly
treads on the heels of a very mild winter.</p>

<p>The glories of the landskip I have always enjoyed; but
Deyverdun has almost given me a taste for minute observation,
and I can dwell with pleasure on the shape and colour of the
leaves, the various hues of the blossoms, and successive progress
of vegetation. These pleasures are not without cares; and there
is a white Acacia just under the windows of my library, which
in my opinion was too closely pruned last Autumn, and whose
recovery is the daily subject of anxiety and conversation! My
romantic wishes led sometimes to an idea which was impracticable
in England, the possession of an house and garden, which
should unite the society of town with the beauties and freedom of
the country. That idea is now realized in a degree of perfection
to which I never aspired, and if I could convey in words a just
picture of my library, apartments, terrace, wilderness, vineyard,
with the prospect of land and water, terminated by the mountains;
and this position at the gate of a populous and lively
town where I have some friends and many acquaintance, you
would envy or rather applaud the singular propriety of my choice.</p>

<p>During the first year of my residence I often compared the
tumult of London and the house of Commons, with the studious
social tranquillity of Lausanne, and felt with complacency that I
had chosen the better part. Those busy scenes are now far from
me, like the remembrance of a noisy and troublesome dream, and
though I possess from nature or reflection a happiness of temper
that can be easy almost in any situation, I am at a loss to
conceive how I could support so long a way of life so ill-suited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to my mind and circumstances. What I particularly disliked was
the alternative of a batchelor, large accidental dinners abroad, or
my solitary chicken at home. Here I can keep a regular table and
establishment equal to the best families of the place; we seldom
dine alone, and I have often agreable suppers of men and women.
The habits of female conversation have sometimes tempted me to
acquire the piece of furniture, a wife, and could I unite in a
single Woman, the virtues and accomplishments of half a dozen
of my acquaintance, I would instantly pay my addresses to the
Constellation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MINISTRY OF RESPECTABLE BOYS.</div>

<p>In the mean while I must content myself with my other wife,
the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, which I prosecute with
pleasant and constant industry. I had some hopes of compleating
it this year, but let no man who builds a house, or writes a book,
presume to say when he will have finished. When he imagines
that he is drawing near to his journey's end, Alps rise on Alps,
and he continually finds something to add, and something to
correct. Yet I <em>now</em> think myself sure of bringing over two or
three Volumes in quarto (down to the taking of Constantinople by
the Turks) in the course of next summer, I mean the summer of
eighty-seven, and as the business of impression will require many
months, I may long enjoy the company of my English friends.
Of private friends I hope to find many in the <em>vulgar</em>, and some
in the <em>pure</em> and <em>genuine</em> sense of the word, but I shall be totally
bewildered. About three months after my departure, an Earthquake
threw down all the men and systems of which I had any
knowledge, and the country seems to be governed by a set of most
respectable boys, who were at school half a dozen years ago. I
see in the papers that young Eliot is become the brother and
privy-Counsellor of Pitt, and that the independent father has no
objection either to titles or places.</p>

<p>And now, My Dear Madam, after so much about myself, let
me conclude with a word of enquiry on a subject very near to my
heart, your health and happiness. The only apprehension from
your silence relates to want of activity and spirits, and from those
fears I hope you can honestly deliver me. Remember me with
kindness to Mrs. Gould, and Mrs. Holroyd, and let me hear if
any thing good has befallen them, more especially the former,
whose situation was more susceptible of change: when I mention
her I include her family. Is Mr. Melmoth still alive? I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
young Coxe last year, with a very decent and reasonable Bear,
whom he leads from North to South. Adieu, Dear Madam, my
paper fails.</p>

<p class="signature">
Most truly yours,<br />

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 10th, 1786.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DEATH OF "AUNT KITTY."</div>

<p>*By the difference, I suppose, of the posts of France and Germany,
Sir Stanier's letter, though first written, is still on the
road, and yours, which I received yesterday morning, brought me
the first account of poor Mrs. P[orten]'s departure. There are
few events that could affect me more deeply, and I have been ever
since in a state of mind more deserving of your pity than of your
reproaches. I certainly am not ignorant that we have nothing
better to wish for ourselves than the fate of that best-humoured
woman, as you very justly style her. A good understanding, and
an excellent heart, with health, spirits, and a competency, to live
in the midst of her friends till the age of fourscore, and then to
shut her eyes without pain or remorse. Death can have deprived
her only of some years of weakness, perhaps of misery; and for
myself it is surely less painful to lose her at present, than to find
her in my visit to England next year sinking under the weight of
age and infirmities, and perhaps forgetfull of herself and of the
persons once the dearest to her.</p>

<p>All this is perfectly true: but all these reflections will not
dispell a thousand sad and tender remembrances that rush upon
my mind. To her care I am indebted in earliest infancy for
the preservation of my life and health. I was a puny child,
neglected by my Mother, starved by my nurse, and of whose
being very little care or expectation was entertained; without
her maternal vigilance I should either have been in my grave,
or imperfectly lived a crooked ricketty monster, a burthen to
myself and others. To her instructions I owe the first rudiments
of knowledge, the first exercise of reason, and a taste for
books, which is still the pleasure and glory of my life; and
though she taught me neither language nor science, she was
certainly the most useful preceptor I have ever had. As I grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
up, an intercourse of thirty years endeared her to me, as the
faithful friend and the agreeable companion. You have seen with
what freedom and confidence we lived together, and have often
admired her character and conversation, which could alike please
the young and the old. All this is now lost, finally, irrecoverably
lost! I will agree with My Lady, that the immortality of the
soul is on some occasions a very comfortable doctrine. A thousand
thanks to her for her constant kind attention to that poor woman
who is no more.</p>

<p>I wish I had as much to applaud and as little to reproach
in my own behaviour towards Mrs. P. since I left England;
and when I reflect that my letters would have soothed and
comforted her decline, I feel more deeply than I can express, the
real neglect, and seeming indifference, of my silence. To delay a
letter from the Wednesday to the Saturday, and then from the
Saturday to the Wednesday, appears a very slight offence; yet in
the repetition of such delay, weeks, months, and years will elapse,
till the omission may become irretrievable, and the consequence
mischievous or fatal. After a long lethargy, I had rouzed myself
last week, and wrote to the three old Ladies; my letter for Newman
Street went away last post, Saturday night, and yours did not
arrive till Monday morning. Sir Stanier will probably open it,
and read the true picture of my sentiments for a friend who, when
I wrote, was already extinct. There is something sad and awful
in the thought, yet on the whole, I am sorry that even this tardy
Epistle preceded my knowledge of her death. But it did not
precede (you will observe) the information of her dangerous and
declining state, which I conveyed in my last letter, and her
anxious concern that she should never see or <em>hear</em> from you again.</p>

<p>This idea, and the hard thoughts which you must entertain of
me, press so hard on my mind, that I must frankly acknowledge a
strange and inexcusable supineness, on which I desire you would
make no comment, and which in some measure may account for
my delays in corresponding with you. The unpleasant nature of
business, and the apprehension of finding something disagreeable,
tempted me to postpone from day to day, not only the answering,
but even the opening, your penultimate epistle; and when I
received your last, yesterday morning, the seal of the former was
still unbroken. Oblige me so far as to make no reflections; my
own may be of service to me hereafter. Thus far (except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
last sentence) I have run on with a sort of melancholy pleasure,
and find my heart much relieved by unfolding it to a friend.
And the subject so strongly holds me, so much disqualifies me
for other discourse, either serious or pleasant, that here I would
willingly stop, and reserve all miscellaneous matter for a second
volunteer Epistle. But we both know how frail are promises, how
dangerous are delays, and there are some pecuniary objects on
which I think it necessary to give you an immediate, though now
tardy, explanation.</p>

<p>I do not return you any formal thanks for* securing me the
£500 at Gosling's. We are sufficiently acquainted with each
other's sentiments, nor can I be surprized that you should do for
me what in a similar situation you would have found and accepted
without hesitation on my part. But I must remove the
appearance of duplicity which might not give you pleasure, that
I should complain of urgent poverty, and doubt whether my
draught would be paid, while I had £400 in Gosling's hands. A
part of this wealth is only ideal, as I had reckoned on Mrs.
Gibbon's Christmas half-year (£150), which was really drawn for
a few days afterwards. For the rest of the difference, I can only
say that I reckoned from memory (having mislaid their last year's
account), that my fears preponderated, and that I am glad to find
myself for once, a richer man than I expected. To show you that
I am in earnest, as I shall not want to draw for some months, I
am very willing that you should divert a part of your supply to
the most pressing occasions. Of that nature is certainly the
Buckinghamshire bond to the man who married Harris's daughter,
and I beg you would pay both principal and interest immediately.
The Jobbman for horses should, I think, be the next, and when
these two are satisfied, upwards of £200 must remain. When I
consider the large amount and easy earning of Newton's bill, he
surely may wait for my return. If you are too much plagued
with his importunities, silence him with another sop of £100.
Whatever you do, you will send me the account, that I may know
the exact quantity of my provision. You know my attachment to
my little deposit in the funds, but if I should be pressed before my
return by any further expences or demands, I will transact the
business with the Darrels either by sale or loan. Apropos of
Newton, were it perfectly convenient, I would not clear his whole
bill, till I had extracted from his hands all the writings of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Hampshire Estate. I wish you would seriously undertake that
extraction, the importance of which you feel more strongly than
myself.</p>

<p>I have really an hundred things to say of myself, of you
and Co., of your works, of mine, of my books in Downing Street,
of Lausanne, of Politicks, &amp;c. &amp;c. After this, some Epistolary
debts must and <small>SHALL</small> be paid; and to proceed with order, I have
fixed this day fortnight (May 25th) for the date and dispatch
of your second Epistle. Give me credit once more. Pray, does
My Lady think herself absolved from all obligation of writing to
me? To <em>her</em>, at least, I am not in arrear. Adieu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOOKS LONGER IN MAKING THAN PUDDINGS.</div>

<p>This general order will, I presume, remove all the unforeseen
difficulties, which I should have thought must have given way to
your name, and the knowledge of our connection. Use the power
according to your own discretion, even to the full amount of your
£500 which I have not yet violated, but remember not to satisfy
Newton till he has disgorged my writings, of which, as you will
easily believe, I have no list. *I suppose you have sworn (I have
sworn myself) at my long silence and delay. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plena Epistola</i>
I have postponed from post to post, and as I see no end of
waiting (though I think it will not run beyond the end of the
month), it seemed most prudent to dispatch this needful missive.
I am well, happy, and diligent; but your kind hint of the London
house is perfectly superfluous; as instead of the <em>spring</em>, we must
already read the <em>summer</em> of next year.* Do not be childish or
passionate; trust me, I wish to appear in England; but it must
be with my book in my hand; and a book takes more time in
making than a pudding. Adieu. Will my Lady never write?</p>

<p class="signature">
E. G.
</p>

<p>*Since I have another page, and some leisure moments, we may
as well employ it in friendly converse; the more so, as the great
letter to which I alluded is most wonderfully precarious and uncertain;
the more so likewise, as our correspondence for some time
past has been of an abrupt, dark and disagreeable cast. Let us
first talk of Sheffield's works; they are of two sorts: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primo</i>, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
nymphs, whom I much desire to see; the stately Maria and the
gentle Louisa. I perfectly represent them both in the eye of fancy;
each of them accomplished according to her age and character, yet
totally different in their external and internal forms. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Secundo</i>,
three pamphlets; pamphlets I cry you mercy; three weighty
treatises, almost as useful as an enquiry into the state of the
primitive Church; and here let me justify, if I have not before,
my silence on a subject which we authors do not easily forgive.
The first, whose first editions had seen the light before I left
England, followed me here in a more compleat condition; and
that Treatise on the American Trade has been read, judged,
approved, and reported. The second, on Ireland, I have seen by
accident, the copy you had sent Mr. Trevor, who passed last
summer (85) in this [place]. The third, and in my present
situation the most interesting, on the French Commerce,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> I have
not yet seen by any means whatsoever, and you who know what
orders you have given to Elmsley or others, will best discern on
whom should be laid the fault and the blame.* By the bye, Mrs.
Trevor is now here without her husband&mdash;so much the better&mdash;and
I am just going to see her, about a mile out of town: she
is judged elegant and amiable; but in health and figure most
lamentably declined since last year. *But to return to your books,
all that I have seen must do you honour, and might do the public
service; you are above the trifling decorations of style and
order, but your sense is strong, your views impartial, and your
industry laudable. I find that your American tract is just translated
into German.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS CONTEMPLATED VISIT TO ENGLAND.</div>

<p>Do you still correspond with* Eden?<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> *If he could establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a beneficial intercourse between the two first nations in the
World, I could excuse him some little political tergiversation.
At some distance of time and place, those domestic squabbles
lose much of their importance; and though I should not forgive
him any breach of private friendship or confidence, I
cannot much blame him if he chose rather to serve his family
and his country, than to persevere in a hopeless and, as I
suspect, an unpopular opposition. You have never told me
clearly and correctly how you support your inactive retreat from
the house of Commons; whether you have resumed your long
forgotten taste for rural and domestic pleasures, and whether you
have never cast a look towards Coventry, or some other borough
equally pure and respectable. In the short space that is left I will
only repeat more distinctly, that in the present contemplation of
my work, June or July of next year is the earliest term at which
I can hope to see England*; and if I have a fit of the Gout&mdash;I
have, indeed, been free from the monster this last twelvemonth;
but he is most arbitrary and capricious. Of my own situation let
me say with truth that it is tranquil, easy, and well adapted to
my character. All enthusiasm is now at an end; I see things in
their true light, and I applaud the judgment and choice of my
retirement.</p>

<p>You see why I have left a blank in the first page; and when I
begun I had no design of going beyond it; and now, unless I
have some extraordinary fit of diligence and zeal, shall probably
wait till the return of your Epistle. A word before we part,
about the least unpleasant of my business; my library in Downing-street.
Excuse the accidental derangement; I shall send for no

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, Jan. 20th, 1787.
</p>

<p>*After some sallies of wrath, you seem at length to have subsided
in sullen silence, and I must confess not totally without
reason. Yet if your mind be still open to truth, you will confess
that I am not quite so black as I appear. 1. Your Lordship has
shewn much less activity and eloquence than formerly, and your
last letter was an answer to mine, which I had expected some
time with impatience. Bad examples are dangerous to young
People. 2. Formerly I have neglected answering your Epistles
on essential, though unpleasant, business; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Res-publica</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">-privata</i> may have suffered by my neglect.* At present, when you
have paid away the £500 of your own creation in Gosling's hands,
satisfied Newton and <em>Job</em> (I do not mean the most patient of
men), and withdrawn my writings from the Attorney's paw, I do
not recollect any matter of interest remaining in your hands to
exercise your industry, vex my temper, or sully your dispatches.
That sum of £500 you will find entire and intact in Fleet Street;
you may exhaust, but in spite of my general credit I hope you
will not exceed it.</p>

<p>*Supposing, therefore, we had no transactions, why should I
write so often? To exchange sentimental compliments, or to
relate the various and important transactions of the Republic
of Lausanne? As long as I do not inform you of my death,
you have good grounds to believe me alive and well: you
have a general, and will soon have a more particular, idea of my
system and arrangement here. One day glides away after another
in tranquil uniformity. Every object must have sides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
moments less luminous than others; but, upon the whole, the
life and the place which I have chosen are most happily adapted
to my character and circumstances; and I can now repeat, at the
end of three years, what I soon and sincerely affirmed, that never,
in a single instant, have I repented of my scheme of retirement to
Lausanne; a retirement which was judged by my best and wisest
friend a project little short of insanity. The place, the people,
the climate, have answered or exceeded my warmest expectations:
and I truly rejoice in my approaching visit to England. Mr. Pitt,
were he your friend and mine, would not find it an easy task to
prevent my return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUILDING A GREAT BOOK.</div>

<p>3. And now let me add a third reason, which often diverted
me from writing; namely, my impatience to see you this next
summer. I am building a great book, which, besides the three
stories already exposed to the public eye, will have three stories
more before we reach the roof and battelments. You too have
built or altered a great Gothic Castle with Baronial battlements;
did you finish it within the time you intended? As that time
drew near, did you not find a thousand nameless and unexpected
works that must be performed; each of them calling for a portion
of time and labour? and had you not despised, nobly despised, the
minute diligence of finishing, fitting up, and furnishing the apartments,
you would have discovered a new train of indispensable
business. Such, at least, has been my case. A long while ago,
when I contemplated the distant prospect of my work, I gave you
and myself some hopes of landing in England last Autumn; but,
alas! when autumn grew near, hills began to rise on hills, Alps on
Alps, and I found my journey far more tedious and toilsome than
I had imagined.</p>

<p>When I look back on the length of the undertaking, and
the variety of materials, I cannot accuse, or suffer myself to
be accused, of idleness; yet it appeared that unless I doubled
my diligence, another year, and perhaps more, would elapse
before I could embark with my complete manuscript. Under
these circumstances I took, and am still executing, a bold and
meritorious resolution. The mornings in winter, and in a
country of early dinners, are very concise; to them, my usual
period of study, I now frequently add the evenings, renounce
cards and society, refuse the most agreeable evenings, or perhaps
make my appearance at a late supper. By this extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
industry, which I never practised before, and to which I hope
never to be again reduced, I see the last part of my history
growing apace under my hands; all my materials are collected
and arranged; I can exactly compute, by the square foot, or the
square page, all that remains to be done; and after concluding
text and notes, after a general review of my time and my ground,
I can now decisively ascertain the final period of the decline and
fall, and can boldly promise that I will dine with you at Sheffield-place
in the month of August, or perhaps of July, in the present
year; within less than a twelfthmonth of the term which I had
loosely and originally fixed; and perhaps it would not be easy to
find a work of that size and importance in which the workman
has so tolerably kept his word with himself and the public. But
in this situation, oppressed with this particular object, and
stealing every hour from my amusement, to the fatigue of the pen
and the eyes, you will conceive, or you might conceive, how little
stomach I have for the Epistolary style; and that instead of idle,
though friendly, correspondence, I think it far more agreeable to
employ my time in the effectual measures that may hasten and
exhilarate our personal interview.</p>

<p>About a month ago I had a voluntary, and not unpleasing
Epistle from Cadell; he informs me that he is going to print
a new octavo edition, the former being exhausted, and that the
public expect with impatience the conclusion of that excellent
work, whose reputation and sale increases every day, &amp;c. I
answered him by the return of the post, to inform him of the
period and extent of my labours, and to express a reasonable
hope that he would set the same value on the three last as
he had done on the three former Volumes. Should we conclude
in this easy manner a transaction so honourable to the
author and bookseller, my way is clear and open before; in
pecuniary matters I think I am assured for the rest of my life of
never troubling my friends, or being troubled myself; a state
to which I aspire, and which I indeed deserve, if not by my
management, at least by moderation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.</div>

<p>In your last, you talk more of the French treaty<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> than of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
yourself and your wife and family; a true English <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid nunc</i>!
For my part, in this remote, inland, neutral country, you will suppose,
that after a slight glance on the papers, I have neither had
the means or the inclination to think very deeply about it. As a
Citizen of the World, a character to which I am every day rising
or sinking, I must rejoyce in every agreement that diminishes the
separation between neighbouring countries, which softens their
prejudices, unites their interest and industry, and renders their
future hostilities less frequent and less implacable. With regard
to the present treaty, I hope both nations are gainers; since
otherwise it cannot be lasting; and such double mutual gain is
surely possible in fair trade, though it could not easily happen in
the mischievous amusements of war and gaming.* I am much
pleased with our great patriots who write to you for sense as
schoolboys on an exercise day. *What a delightful hand have these
great statesmen made of it since my departure! without power,
and, as far as I can see, without hope. When we meet I shall
advise you to digest all your political and commercial knowledge,
(England, Ireland, France, America,) and, with some attention to
style and order, to make the whole a Classic book, which may
preserve your name and benefit your Country. I know not
whether you have seen Sir Henry Clinton since his return: he
passed a day with me, and seemed pleased with my reception and
place. We talked over you and the American War. Mrs. Trevor
passes the winter here: she is pleasing and fashionable. I
embrace the <em>silent My Lady</em> and the two honourable Misses, whom
I sigh to behold and admire. Adieu. Ever yours.*</p>

<p>I have three or four things to add of meaner importance.</p>

<p>1. My Journey to England costs me a good servant: he has a
farm, a shop, and a wife: absence from these frightens him, and
he takes this opportunity of retiring from the domestic state.</p>

<p>2. *Though I can part with land, you find I cannot part with
books: the remainder of my library has so long embarrassed your
stinking room that it may now await my presence and final
judgment.*</p>

<p>3. All my coloured handkerchiefs are worn out: I wish My
Lady would get me a couple of dozen of the best sort from
Ireland: an elegant Poplin would likewise be acceptable for a fur
Coat. *Has the said My Lady read a novel intitled Caroline
de Lichfield, of our home manufacture? I may say of ours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
since Deyverdun and myself were the judges and patrons of the
Manuscripts. The author, who is since married a second time,
(Madame de Crousaz, now Montolieu), is a charming woman.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> I
was in some danger.* Once more, bar a long fit of the Gout,
and the historian will land at Dover before the end of July.
Adieu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTENTION TO ARRIVE IN LONDON.</div>

<p>*I begin to discover that if I wait till I could atchieve a just
and satisfactory Epistle, equally pleasant and instructive, you
would have a poor chance of hearing from me. I will therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
content myself with a simple answer to a question, which (I
love to believe) you repeat with some impatience: "When may
we expect you in England?" My great building is, as it were,
compleated, and some slight ornaments, the painting and glazing
of the last finished rooms, may be dispatched without inconvenience
in the autumnal residence of Sheffield-place. It is
therefore my sincere and peremptory intention to depart from
Lausanne about the 20th of July, and to find myself (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">me trouver</i>)
in London on or before the glorious first of August. I know of
nothing that can prevent it but a fit of the gout, the capricious
tyrant, who obeys no laws either of time or place; and so
unfortunately are we circumstanced, that such a fit, if it came
late and lasted long, would effectually disable me from coming
till next spring; since thereby I should lose the season, the
monsoon, for the impression of three quarto volumes, which will
require nine months (a regular parturition), and cannot advantageously
appear before the beginning or middle of May.</p>

<p>At the same time do not be apprehensive that I mean to play
you a dog's trick. From a thousand motives it is my wish to
come over this year; the desire of seeing you, and the <em>silent sullen</em>
My lady; the family arrangements, discharge of servants, which I
have already made; the strong wish of settling my three youngest
children in a manner honourable to them and beneficial to their
parent. Much miscellaneous matter rises to my pen, but I will
not be tempted to turn the leaf. Expect me therefore at Sheffield-place,
with strong probability, about the 15th of August.* You
say nothing of your final settlement with Newton: if the Attorney
refuses to give parchments for money he must have some bad
intention. Adieu. Yours.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, July 21st, 1787.
</p>

<p>*The 20th of July is past, and I am still at Lausanne; but the
march of heavy bodies, such as armies and historians, can seldom
be foreseen or fixed to a precise day. Some particular reasons
have engaged me to allow myself another week; and the day of
my departure is now (<em>I believe</em>) determined for Sunday the 29th
instant. You know the road and the distance. I am no rapid
English traveller, and my servant is not accustomed to ride post.
I was never fond of deeds of darkness, and if the weather be hot,
we must repose in the middle of the day. Yet the roads are in
general good: between Sun and Sun the interval is long; and,
barring the accidents of winds and waves, I think it possible to
reach London in ten or twelve days; <em>viz.</em> on or before the ninth
of August. With your active spirit, you will scarce understand
how I can look on this easy journey with some degree of
reluctance and apprehension; but after a tranquil, sedentary life
of four years, (having lain but a single night out of my own bed,)
I see mountains and monsters in the way; and so happy do I
feel myself <em>at home</em>, that nothing but the strongest calls of friendship
and interest could drag me from hence.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS ARRIVAL IN LONDON.</div>

<p>You ingeniously propose that I should turn off at Sittenbourn,
and seem to wonder what business I can find, or make, for an
immediate residence in the Capital. Have you totally forgot
that I bring over three quarto volumes for the press? and are
you ignorant that not a moment must be lost, if we are desirous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of appearing at a proper season? I must ratify and sign my
agreement with Cadell and Strahan, deliver the first part of
the manuscript, settle some preliminaries with the printer and
corrector, revise the first sheets, procure some necessary books,
consult others, and set the machine in motion before I can secede
to Sheffield-place with an easy mind, and for a reasonable term.
Of this be assured, that I shall not be less impatient than yourself,
and that, of human two-legged animals, yourself and yours
are the first, though not the sole, whom I shall wish to see in
England.</p>

<p>For myself, I do not regret the occupancy of Downing
Street;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> in my first visit to London, a lodging or hotel in the
Adelphi will be more convenient; but I have some anxiety about
my books, and must try whether I can approach those holy relicks,
without offending the delicacy of an amiable Dutchess.</p>

<p>Our interview is so near, that I have little more to add, except
a single caution about my own concerns, in which you will confess,
that from Lovegrove, and Winton, to Newton, I have been
generally unlucky. If any thing remains, present or future, it
must be agitated and decided; but all retrospects are useless and
painful, and we have so many pleasant subjects of conversation,
that all such odious matters may be buried in oblivion. Adieu.
I embrace My Lady and Louisa, but I no longer presume, even on
paper, to embrace the tall and blooming Maria.</p>

The post had left town before my arrival. I am pleased, but

six hundred miles, and hardly yet conceive how I had resolution
to undertake it. I find myself not a little fatigued, and have
devoted this hot day to privacy and repose, without having seen
any body except Cadell and Elmsley, and my neighbour Batt,
whose civility amounts to kindness and real friendship. But you
may depend on it, that instead of sauntering in town, or giving
way to every temptation, I will dispatch my necessary work, and
hasten with impatience to the groves of Sheffield-place; a project
somewhat more rational than the hasty, turbulent visit which
your vigour had imagined. If you come up to quicken my

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO MR. GIBBONS.</div>

<p>I am extremely happy that by Mrs. Holroyd's kind
enquiries in my name, the veil is at length withdrawn, and a
mistake is removed which has given us, with an appearance of
reason, some mutual anxiety. No one doubtless is less entitled
than myself to confound the indolence of the pen with the coldness
of the heart, yet I must confess that I was surprized and
grieved, that you should not take the smallest notice of the letter
in which I had announced my arrival in England. Each post
encreased my uneasiness, which was at the same time aggravated
and soothed by the assurance from Mrs. H. that illness could not
be the cause of your silence, and this day was the last which I
had fixed for asking the favour of a line of comfort and explanation.
By this you will understand that I have never received
your kind answer directed to me in town, and, though the loss of
a letter by the post is a rare, and to many, an incredible event,
I can explain it in this instance by a singular concurrence of
circumstances. Two Hotels which bear the name of the Adelphi
stand opposite to each other, and two Mr. Gibbons were lodged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
at the same time in the adverse houses, as Lord Sheffield perceived
on his coming up to find me out. Your direction was applied
to my rival, and as he had already departed into the country, his
letter must have been sent after him, and he alone is guilty for
not acknowledging and rectifying the error.</p>

<p>I have now passed some weeks with our friends Lord and
Lady Sheffield, who wish me to express in their name every
sentiment of attachment and regard; they both lament the
disappointment of their wishes of enjoying your company in this
place, and would promise that during your stay, it should not
be profaned by any American rebels, or any fashionable females
whose conduct may be less calculated to edify than to please. I
am here, very idle and very busy. After building a great house, a
thousand little alterations, improvements and ornaments present
themselves to the architect, and besides the trouble of painting
and glazing some of the last apartments, I have the daily duty of
receiving, correcting, and returning a printed sheet which is sent
me from London. Impatient as I am to visit Bath, I must defer
my journey till I am in a great measure got out of my litterary
brick and mortar; and if I can postpone it till the beginning of
December, Lord Sheffield gives me hopes of his company. The
moments I can pass with you will be some of the most pleasing of
my life, and it will give me real concern, that I shall find it
impossible to prolong my visit as I could wish, much less to fix
my winter residence at Bath.</p>

<p>Besides my usual dislike to letter-writing for which you

for my silence in the weekly dispatches which are transmitted
from hence to Bath, and by which you are frequently apprized of
my health and good spirits, the only circumstances which I could

I leave this place next Sunday, and as I hope that a fortnight <em>may</em>
suffice for some litterary business (consulting books, &amp;c.) which
can only be dispatched in town, I reckon with confidence on the
satisfaction of embracing you at the Belvidere within a month
from the present time. As to my old enemy the gout, it is impossible
to answer for his motions, but I have not the slightest
grounds to suspect him of any hostile intentions. Lord Sheffield
wishes to accompany me in the journey and return, but so many
obstacles may impede a man of business, that I must not depend
on him with any degree of assurance. Will you be so good as
to inform his sister how much I am obliged to her for thinking
so often and so kindly of me?</p>

<p>I wish it were in your power to give me a more favourable
account of your health, or at least of your strength, for I flatter
myself that it is in the latter you are chiefly deficient. I am not
without apprehension that the sight of a long-lost friend may
exhaust your spirits by too much painful pleasure. Be persuaded,
my Dear Madam, that you are the sole object of my journey, that
I most sincerely request that you will not contrive any dinners or
parties for my amusement, that my time will be most agreably
spent in your conversation, and that I could wish to enlarge the
number of days which my avocations in life and litterature will
allow me to enjoy at Bath. Do not give yourself the trouble of

<p>The assurance that neither giants nor dragons were to be

leave to your fancy or judgment the well-known circumstances of
changing horses, alighting from the chaise, surveying the lodging
(bad and dear), ordering a fowl from the Cocoa-tree, &amp;c., &amp;c., and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
I feel every day the awkwardness of the six o'clock post. The
first evening I passed at home and had scarcely dined when the
Poet Hayley was announced: he embraced, forgave me, and we
entered on a pleasant conversation of two hours. I mentioned to
him your Christmas plan: he is grateful, but seems to decline
it. However I shall see him again, and possibly he may fall in
your way.</p>

<p>You would make me vain; nor am I less touched by the
growlings of my lady, than by the praises of the Maria, whose
probable excursion I applaud. As yet I have chiefly attended to
my litterary concerns, and have only seen Crauford, the Lucans,
Sir Joshua, &amp;c. I have knocked without success at Lord Loughborough's
door, but shall dine with him before the end of the
week, perhaps with M. de Calonne,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> who is a favourite with all
parties. Pitt in the <em>general</em> opinion seems to be the Hero of the
day, and Lord Lucan, fresh from Paris, says that nothing can
equal the conscious shame of the French, except their public
abhorrence of the Queen, and their wild resolutions of freedom.
Take care of Severy,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> I had rather he did not go to Lewes: a set

say that my departure for Bath is fixed for Saturday sennight, and
that I shall expect you, &amp;c., on Thursday at latest. For the

<p>*I precipitate! I inconvenience! Alas! alas! I am a poor
miserable cripple, confined to my chair. Last Wednesday
evening I felt some flying symptoms of the gout: for two
succeeding days I struggled bravely, and went in a chair to dine
with Batt and Lord Loughborough: but on Saturday I yielded
to my conqueror. I have now passed three wearisome days
without amusement, and three miserable nights without sleep.
Yet my acquaintance are charitable; and as virtue should never
be made too difficult, I feel that a man has more friends in Pall
Mall than in Bentinck Street. This fit is remarkably painful;
the enemy is possessed of the left foot and knee, and how far he
may carry the war, God only knows. Of futurity it is impossible
to speak; but it will be fortunate if I am able to leave town by
the end, not of this, but of the ensuing week. Pity me, magnanimous
Baron; pity me, tender females; pity me, Swiss exile,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
and believe me, it is far better to be learning English at Uckfield.
I write with difficulty, as the least motion or constraint in my
attitude is repeated by all the nerves and sinews in my knee.
But* in the daily papers *you shall find each day a note or bulletin
of my health. To-morrow I must give pain to Mrs. G. Adieu.*
Caplin's servant has other offers, and grows impatient for a speedy
and final answer.</p>

<p>I must reluctantly mention, what I could still wish to

been already betrayed by the Sheffield gazette. Your suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were but too just, and both my feet have been for some days past
in the iron fetters of the gout. This obstacle must retard, though
it shall not prevent my journey to Bath, and as soon as I am able
to travel I shall summon Lord S., who with his daughter Maria is
impatient to start. No term can be possibly assigned, but I feel
with pleasure that the bitterness of the fit is past or passing, and
the gouty tide now appears to ebb; whether its retiring motions
will be slow or rapid, fluctuating or regular, I cannot foresee, but I

<div class="sidenote">DISARRANGEMENT OF HIS PLANS.</div>

<p>I thought we might have safely depended on Caplin's <em>daily</em>
diligence, but you could fairly conclude from his silence that we
advance with a fair wind. The venom of the Gouty humour is
almost dispelled, and I am going on to reduce the size and recover
the strength of my feet. Mama cannot be more impatient than
myself for the signal of weighing anchor: this unlucky check has
disarranged all my social and litterary projects: in a lodging
I am destitute of a thousand comforts: my books are few, my
society precarious, my days long and often tedious, nor is any
thing less pleasant than to be left solitary and motionless while
the world is flying round and round me. In point of kind, civil,
assiduous attendance of male and female friends Lausanne had
quite spoilt me.</p>

<p>In the course or chain of my winter designs, I most ardently
wish to hasten the Bath journey, that I may urge our family
settlement in Downing street, for I have felt by experience the
difference between town and country with regard to the press.
But wishes are not hopes, nor are hopes equivalent to assurances.
Yet I think (should no reverse of fortune take place) that I can
promise to ascend my post-chaise painfully enough either Friday
or Saturday next, the 14th or 15th instant, and therefore, if you
hear nothing to the contrary, your Lordship <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum mamma amabili</i>
may find yourself in town the Wednesday or Thursday, and we
will contrive, if I am strong enough, some dinner with Lord L.,
Batt, or elsewhere. I am much obliged to Severy for his letter
and Lausanne news. I hope he is somewhat less miserable.

</p>

<p>*Alas! alas! alas! How vain and fallacious are all the designs
of man. This is now the 18th of December, precisely one month
since my departure from Sheffield-place; and it was firmly my
wish, my hope, my resolution, that after dispatching some needful
business in London, and accomplishing a pious duty at Bath, I
should by this day be restored to the tranquil leisure, and friendly
society, of S. P. A cruel tyrant has disconcerted all my plans;
my business in town has been neglected, my attendance at Bath
is just begun, and my return is yet distant. I was not a little
edified to hear of some expressions of regret and discontent on
my departure; and though I am not able to produce as good
evidence, you will perhaps believe that in the solitude of a London
lodging I often railed at the gout for maliciously delaying his
attack till I was removed from a place where my sufferings would
have been alleviated by every kind and comfortable attention. I
grew at last so desperately impatient, as to resolve on immediate
flight, without waiting till I had totally expelled the foe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
recovered my strength. I performed the journey with tolerable
ease, but the motion has agitated the remains of the humour. I
am very lame, and a second fit may possibly be the punishment
of my rashness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ACT OF DUTY AT BATH.</div>

<p>As yet I have seen nothing of Bath except Mrs. G.; and
weakness, as well as propriety, will confine me very closely to her.*
I am carried over the way in a chair about one o'clock, maintain
a conversation till ten o'clock in the evening, and am then reconveyed
to my lodging. *Lord S., with Mrs. Holroyd and Maria,
dined with us yesterday* on the haunch of venison, but such reliefs
are not always to be expected, and I chearfully perform an act
of duty which is necessary and cannot be long. I am astonished
to see Mrs. Gibbon so well, and though undoubtedly weaker, she
seems in the last five years to be very little altered either in
mind or person. *We begin to throw out hints of the shortness of
our stay, and indispensable business; and, unless I should be confined
by the gout, it is resolved in our cabinet to leave Bath on
Thursday the 26th, and passing through Lord Loughborough's
and town, to settle at Sheffield, most assuredly, before the end
of the year.* Maria, to whom every object is new and pleasant,
and who begins to undraw the curtain of the great theatre,
wonders and almost murmurs at our impatience. *For my own
part I can say with truth, that did not the press loudly demand
my presence, I could, without a sigh, allow the Dutchess to reign
in Downing Street the greatest part of the winter, and should
be happy in the society of two persons (no common blessing)
whom I love, and by whom I am beloved.* I understand with
pleasure and gratitude that with the assistance of two Ushers
(Miss Firth and Mrs. Moss) you have undertaken the care of
Severy's English studies, from whence I expect a most rapid
progress. I know not whether yours in Trisset will be equal.
Pray inform our pupil, that I shall write from hence to his
parents, that I am much obliged to him for his letter, which I
hope to answer in a fortnight at Sheffield-place.</p>

<p class="head">
Bath, January 4th, 1788.
</p>

<p>I congratulate you and myself on what I now consider as
certain, the evacuation of Downing Street. Col. Fullarton, a
cousin of the Dutchess, informed me yesterday, that after sending
her children I know not where, perhaps to the parish, she had
indignantly fled into the country. By this day's post I expect
an official confirmation from Lord S., and as he will probably
reach you as soon as this letter, the communication will inform
him of my intended motions. You will admire the triumphant
Maria, and your observation will soon discern whether it will
be easy to brush the powder out of her hair, and the world out
of her heart, or to shut her eyes after they have been once opened
to the light of pleasure. This excursion will render our scheme
still more necessary, and in my letter from hence I sound Madame
de S. on the subject: the more I revolve it, I think the exchange
will be pleasant and beneficial to my English and Swiss friends,
whose mutual advantage I shall have the advantage of promoting.
You have already understood that my precipitation in leaving
London has been justly punished by a second and worse fit of
the gout and a fortnight's confinement.</p>

<p>I now begin to crawl again on two crutches, and my first
sally in a chair will be to return the charitable visits of the
Dutchess and her friend the Ætherial of poor Lord North, &amp;c.
Were I capable of listening to experience or common sense, I
should remain here a week or ten days longer; but I am so
impatient to leave this place and to reach London and S. P. that
I mean to escape next Monday: Tuesday afternoon and all
Wednesday will be the least that my litterary business in town
will require, and I have hopes of dining at S. P. on Thursday the
10th instant, after an absence twice as long and ten times as
disagreeable as I expected. As I now run, not from you, but to
you, you will view my rashness with indulgence, and nurse my
infirmities with compassion.&mdash;Excuse me to Severy for not answering
his two letters, and let him be in readiness to receive me.

<p>Both as an author and as a friend I am delighted with

the perusal of my history<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> may sometimes beguile a solitary hour,
and recall the historian still more forcibly to your mind. For my
own part I now feel as if a mountain was removed from my
breast; as far as I can judge, the public unanimously applauds
my compliment to Lord North,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and does not appear dissatisfied
with the conclusion of my work. I look back with amazement
on the road which I have travelled, but which I should never
have entered had I been previously apprized of its length.</p>

<p>In your last letter you express some joy at the approach of
summer, as it is connected with my second visit to Bath which
I had promised to make before my departure for the Continent.
On my side the promise will be most chearfully performed, and
in the prospect of embracing a dear and valuable friend I shall
ever esteem fatigue and expence as of small account. The
Sheffields leave town in the beginning of next week; I must
continue some days after them to pack up my books and dispatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
some necessary business, and in about a fortnight I could undertake
the journey to Bath. Yet before you resolve, I wish you
coolly to weigh whether prudence should advise us to gratify or
restrain our inclination. In my Christmas visit, confined as I
was by the gout, I could not but observe how much my presence
and your desire of inviting company to amuse me deranged the
privacy of your life and the distribution of your hours. Delicate
health and spirits like yours are agitated even by the pleasure,
the tumultuous pleasure, of an interview; and that pleasure is
embittered by the painful foresight of an approaching separation.
According to my arrangements, which it is no longer in my
power to break, I <em>must</em> return to Lausanne early in the month of
July, nor can I indulge my wishes at the Belvidere beyond the
term of a week. That week is perfectly at your service, and
I only hope to receive your commands as soon as possible. Lord

Caplen has finished the Herculean labour, and seven Majestic

rigour of Lord Howe, who has assured our great and fair Intercessors,

<p>With Lord Sheffield's advice I begin to entertain some

that while I diminish my cares, I may almost double my income.
Before any serious steps are taken in the business, your ease

considerable part of the purchase money on the Estate, your
jointure may be secured on the same kinds as firmly as before.
Lord Sheffield, in whose honour and abilities you have a perfect

<p>A kind and generous behaviour is what I always expect

agree with you in wishing to refer the detail of this business to

is too discreet to have opened his mouth on a subject, on which

<p>*I have but a moment to say, before the departure of the post,
that, after a very pleasant journey, I arrived here about half an
hour ago; that I am as well arranged, as if I had never stirred
from this place; and that dinner on the table is just announced.
Severy I dropt at his country-house about two leagues off. I
just saluted the family, who dine with me the day after to-morrow,
and return to town for some days, I hope weeks, on my
account. The son is an amiable and grateful Youth; and even
this journey has taught me to know and to love him still better.
My satisfaction would be compleat, had I not found a sad and
serious alteration in poor Deyverdun; but thus our joys are
checkered! I embrace all; and at this moment feel the last pang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of our parting at Tunbridge. Convey this letter or information,
without delay, from Sheffield-place to Bath. In a few days I
shall write more amply to both places.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>The day and indeed the moment of my arrival in this
place I announced the event by a short missive to Sheffield-place,
and desired that the intelligence might be forwarded without delay
to the Belvidere. The perils of the ocean and the road, imaginary
perils, are now over, and I am again seated in the elegant repose
of my library and garden: free to enjoy all the pleasures of
study, my first pleasures, but no longer chained to the regular
performance of a laborious task. At this time of the year small
as well as great cities are emptied of their most dignified
inhabitants: yet if I were not rather disposed to a sedentary life,
I could find in the town and adjacent country what Mr. Christie (?)
calls a very respectable vicinage. But their names and characters
would be uninteresting to you, and with the best intentions a
correspondence with a distant friend must degenerate into mutual
questions and answers concerning each other. The only person
here with whom you are acquainted, poor Deyverdun, is, I much
fear, in a state of decline, though I hope not of actual danger:
that would indeed be a loss.</p>

<p>Present my kindest remembrance to Mrs. Holroyd, and if they
are with you, to the Goulds. I lament that I never saw them
during my stay in England.</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>

<p class="head">
October 1, 1788.
</p>

<p>*After such an act of vigour as my first letter, composed,
finished, and dispatched within half an hour after my landing,
while the dinner was smoaking on the table, your knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the animal must have taught you to expect a proportionable
degree of relaxation; and you will be satisfied to hear, that, for
many Wednesdays and Saturdays, I have consumed more time
than would have sufficed for the Epistle, in devising reasons for
procrastinating it to the next post. At this very moment I begin
so very late, as I am just going to dress, and dine in the Country,
that I can take only the benefit of the date, October the first, and
must be content to seal and send my letter next Saturday.</p>


<p class="head"><br />
October the 4th.
</p>

<p>Saturday is now arrived, and I much doubt whether I shall
have time to finish. I rose, as usual, about seven; but as I knew
I should have so much time, you know it would have been
ridiculous to begin any thing before Breakfast. When I returned
from my breakfast-room to the library, unluckily I found on the
table some new and interesting books, which instantly caught
my attention; and without injuring my correspondent, I could
safely bestow a single hour to gratify my curiosity. Some things
I found in them insensibly led me to other books, and other
enquiries; the morning has stolen away, and I shall be soon
summoned to dress and dine with the two Severys, father and son,
who are returned from the Country on a disagreeable errand, an
illness of Madame, from which she is, however, recovering. Such
is the faithful picture of my mind and manners, and from a single
day <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disce omnes</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ILLNESS OF DEYVERDUN.</div>

<p>After having been so long chained to the oar, in a splendid
galley indeed, I freely and fairly enjoy my liberty as I promised
in my preface; range without controul over the wide expanse
of my library; converse, as my fancy prompts me, with poets
and historians, philosophers and Orators, of every age and
language; and often indulge my meditations in the invention
and arrangement of mighty works, which I shall probably never
find time or application to execute. My garden, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berceau</i>, and
pavillion often varied the scene of my studies; the beautiful
weather which we have enjoyed exhilarated my spirits, and I
again tasted the wisdom and happiness of my retirement, till that
happiness was interrupted by a very serious calamity, which took
from me, for above a fortnight, all thoughts of study, of amusement,
and even of correspondence. I mentioned in my first letter
the uneasiness I felt at poor Deyverdun's declining health, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
much the pleasure of my life was embittered by the sight of a
suffering and languid friend. The joy of our meeting appeared
at first to revive him; and, though not satisfied, I began to think,
at least to hope, that he was every day gaining ground; when,
alas! one morning I was suddenly recalled from my berceau to
the house, with the dreadful intelligence of an Apoplectic stroke;
I found him senseless: the best assistance was instantly collected;
and he had the aid of the genius and experience of Mr. Tissot,
and of the assiduous care of an ordinary Physician, who for some
time scarcely quitted his bedside either night or day.* You will
understand his danger when I recapitulate the operations of a few
hours&mdash;leeches, six bleeding vomits, purges, clysters, blisters to his
thighs, warm baths, and mustard to his feet. *While I was in
momentary dread of a relapse, with a confession from his physicians
that such a relapse must be fatal, you will feel that I was much
more to be pitied than my friend. At length, Art or Nature
triumphed over the enemy of life. I was soon assured that all
immediate danger was past: and now for many days I have had
the satisfaction of seeing him recover, though by slow degrees, his
health and strength, his sleep and appetite. He now walks about
the garden, and receives his particular friends, but has not yet
gone abroad. His future health will depend very much upon his
own prudence: but, at all events, this has been a very serious
warning; and the slightest indisposition will hereafter assume a
very formidable aspect.</p>

<p>But let us turn from this melancholy subject.&mdash;The man of
the people<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> escaped from the tumult, the bloody tumult of the
Westminster Election,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> to the lakes and mountains of Switzerland,
and I was informed that he was arrived at the Lyon d'Or.
I sent a compliment; he answered it in person;* we returned
together to the Inn, brought away the fair Mrs. Armstead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
*and settled at my house for the remainder of the day. I have
eat and drank, and conversed and sat up all night with Fox in
England; but it never has happened, perhaps it never can happen
again, that I should enjoy him as I did that day, alone,* for his
fair Companion was a cypher,* from ten in the morning till ten
at night. Poor Deyverdun, before his accident, wanted spirits
to appear, and has regretted it since. Our conversation never
flagged a moment; and he seemed thoroughly pleased with the
place and with his Company. We had little politicks; though
he gave me, in a few words, such a character of Pitt, as one great
man should give of another his rival: much of books, from my
own, on which he flattered me very pleasantly, to Homer and the
Arabian nights; much about the country, my garden (which he
understands far better than I do), and, upon the whole, I think
he envies me, and would do so were he Minister. The next
morning I gave him a guide to walk him about the town and
country, and invited some company to meet him at dinner. The
following day he continued his journey to Berne and Zurich, and I
have heard of him by various means. The people gaze on him as
a prodigy, but he shows little inclination to converse with them.*
The wit and beauty of his Companion are not sufficient to excuse
the scandalous impropriety of shewing her to all Europe, and you
will not easily conceive how he has lost himself in the public
opinion, which was already more favourable to his Rival. Will
Fox never know the importance of character?</p>

<p>Far different has been the conduct and success of *our friend
Douglas;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> he has been curious, attentive, agreeable; and in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
place where he has resided some days, he has left acquaintance
who esteem and regret him: I never knew so clear and general an
impression.</p>

<p>After this long letter I have yet many things to say, though
none of any pressing consequence. I hope you are not idle in
the deliverance of Buriton, though the late events and edicts in
France begin to reconcile me to the possession of dirty acres.
What think you of Necker<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and the States generals? Are not
the public expectations sanguine? Adieu. I will write soon to
My Lady separately, though I have not any particular subject for
her ear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INSANITY OF GEORGE III.</div>

<p>*As I have no Correspondents but yourself, I should have been
reduced to the stale and stupid communications of the papers, if
you had not most gloriously dispatched me a sketch of the* strange
revolution that three Kingdoms should depend on the brain of
one man!<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> *In so new a case the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salus populi</i> must be the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
law; and any extraordinary acts of the two remaining branches
of the Legislature must be excused by necessity, and ratified by
general consent.* Yet I cannot any more than yourself understand
this speedy and peremptory sentence of the Medical tribe.
The apprehension or rather hope of his death may admonish the
reigning ministers not to irritate the heir apparent: otherwise,
since they have a Majority, what should prevent them from
shackling him with a Counsel, or from tacking to the address of
support a request that he would not change his servants? They
have the confidence (aye growl) of the Country and of Europe:
by <em>them</em>, I mean Pitt. *Till things are settled, I expect a regular
Journal.</p>

<p>From kingdoms I descend to farms,* and the latter in a selfish
consideration are not the least important and interesting. You
seem to have made a considerable progress in the Buriton affair,
since you would not have fixed the price without a careful survey
and valuation of each particular founded on your own judgement
and that of some able professor. You do not however mention
that you have employed any such person. I submit to your
science, but I cannot say that I am fond of this mode of auctions:
besides the publicity, which on this occasion may be dangerous,
you expose yourself either to let the estate go for an inadequate
price or to an improper purchaser; or else by purchasing it in,
you incur the expences, tax, &amp;c., to a large amount. Since we
know the persons whom Buriton best suits, suppose Bonham,
Lords Stawell, and Egremont, might not the same end be answered
with less inconvenience by writing at the same time a public
circular letter to each, and desiring that by a certain day they
would send in sealed proposals? Would they not have the same
inducement to bid against one another? Upon the whole the
18,000 pounds would make me happy for life. Yet I would not
proceed hastily in this momentous business. What is the motive
of Hugonin's sudden migration, is it health, distress, fancy?
Where does he settle? Who will take care of my affairs? A
year's rent is now due, besides some arrears.</p>

<p>I have written to my two old Ladies without receiving
answers. What are your accounts from Bath? I hope you
have satisfied <em>her</em> about the sale of Buriton, which I would
much sooner delay than give her any uneasiness. I wish we
had a correspondent at Stamford (that Attorney whose name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
I have forgot, who called upon me in Downing Street) to give
you notice in case it should please Almighty God, &amp;c.&mdash;Deyverdun
is not worse. Yet I much doubt whether you will see
him next year. Do you still persist? Thinking as you do, I feel
the force of a certain objection, and must own that a small
circle is often more dangerous than a large one. I likewise fear
for yourself the want of occupation in winter, and am now
apprehensive of the views of Parliament, office, &amp;c., that may
open themselves under a new and friendly reign. As soon as
you are <em>absolutely</em> determined let me know; as the arrangement
of a proper house would not be easy.</p>

<p>The Severys are well and <em>all</em> impatient to see you. I have
passed three weeks with them at Rolle, as comfortably as at S.P.:
we made a tour to Geneva. The youth is perfectly reconciled to
his little Country. If My Lady, in the paradise of Brighton, could
find leisure for a line, it would be gracious. Adieu.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF HUGONIN.</div>

<p>Poor Hugonin! I can assure you that my thoughts, my first
thoughts at least when I read your letter, turned much more on
himself. I knew him from my youth: he was an honest useful
friend, and though he could never be much of a companion to me,
I always loved and esteemed him. His death is a loss if an
auction at Petersfield was ever an advisable measure. You have
considered and must have determined before this can reach you.
But if it be not too late, revolve the advantages and inconveniences
of auctions.</p>

<p>Buriton is no elegant villa which may catch the eye and fancy
of a stranger; it is an heap of dirty acres which can only derive
their extraordinary value from local merit. Will any man give
so much as Mr. Bonham and Lord Stawell, and in that case would
not a private treaty with them be more easy and effectual? I
again repeat that Mrs. Gibbon must be perfectly satisfied. I
hope you will not let it go under £18,000. We once talked of
twenty.</p>

<p>*Of public affairs I can only hear with curiosity and wonder:
careless as you may think me, I feel myself deeply interested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
You must now write often; make Miss Firth copy any curious
fragments; and stir up any of my well-informed acquaintance,
Batt, Douglas, Adam, perhaps Lord Loughborough, &amp;c., to correspond
with me; I <em>will</em> answer them.</p>

<p>We are now cold and gay at Lausanne. The Severys came to
town Yesterday. I saw a good deal of Lords Malmsbury<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and
Beauchamp and their Ladies; Ellis,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> of the Rolliad, was with
them; I like him much: I gave them a great dinner.</p>

<p>Adieu for the present. Deyverdun is not worse.*</p>

<p>Will you direct Richard Andrews to collect and remitt my
year's rent which is now payable? I suppose he can be trusted,
and that you can authorize him. H.'s departure seems to be a
new reason for disposing of Buriton.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUGONIN'S DISHONESTY.</div>

<p>This moment I receive and answer your Epistle. We are in
the midst of the hardest winter I ever felt, and three English
mails are arrived at once this morning. A black prospect indeed
of public and private affairs, and such is my patriotism that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
must fairly own the latter are predominant in my thoughts. Is
it possible that my old friend poor Hugonin should turn out a
rogue? I thought him both an honest and a frugal man, but
the facts you mention are strongly against him. Is it possible
that his landed property, which was considerable, should be
insufficient to satisfy my demands and those of all his creditors?
Is it possible that, living retired in the Country, he should have
deranged his affairs? I still flatter myself that his executors
must and can repay any sums which he may have <em>borrowed</em> in my
name, and though there should be some delay, I still hope that,
with proper steps on your side, there will not finally be much loss.
If all is indeed desperate down to Hugonin's strange receipt in
full, it is not a year but a year and a half's rent that I have
miserably lost, as I had been persuaded or compelled to allow six
months' grace, and to be satisfied with receiving before Christmas
the year's rent which had been due the preceding Lady-day.
There is besides some arrear of rent from the College farms which
was due at the time of the sale, and which Hugonin has never
clearly settled. Such a blow, at least of seven or eight hundred
pounds, will most essentially distress me, and derange those
schemes of comfort and order which I now thought most firmly
established. You are my only refuge. Could I hope (I may wish,
I must not ask) that you would get into your post-chaise in
Downing Street and run down to Petersfield? Your eagle-eye
and active firmness would see more and do more in eight and
forty hours than all the agents and letters in the World. If this
be too much, a man of confidence (is Purden fit for the commission?)
might be sent to make a full observation and report of the state
of accounts, and of the farm at Beriton with respect both to
present arrangements and final operations. Andrews has a fair
character, but an Attorney!</p>

<p>This unforeseen and unfortunate blow encreases my desire
of getting rid of such dangerous and ungovernable property;
and from the produce of any sum between 18 and 15,000 pounds
I could certainly draw a larger and safer income than I enjoy
at present. But how to proceed. Is Mrs. G. of Bath perfectly
satisfied? I have not heard from her nor do you mention her
name. Have you heard of the Northamptonshire Saint? You
wait for my instructions, I can send none. You are an able
and active friend, and I shall acquiesce in all you think right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
even in the auction, which does not thoroughly suit my taste.
I should prefer a fair Gentlemanlike private address to Bonham
either by letter or in person. For God's sake, or rather for
friendship's sake, comfort and extricate me. I am in low spirits.
Adieu.</p>

<p class="signature">

</p>

<p>Write soon&mdash;I think the earliest and most vigorous steps
should be taken for making my demand on H.'s executors. Is
there no allusion between him and the Tenant? if there is would
it not invalidate his <em>unusual</em> receipt?</p>

<h2>539.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, Feb. 4th, 1789.
</p>

<p>If Hugonin's debt be desperate I must submit, but there is no
<em>imbecillity</em> in saying that the loss will derange my plans, since I
must sell out of the funds to supply the deficiency. The amount
of my fruitless demand I cannot specify, but you may easily make
it out by comparing Hugonin's remittances to the Goslings with
the rent-roll of the Estate. Mrs. G. of Bath must doubtless be
satisfied and secured in any way and on any fund which her
prudence or fancy may prefer. You had once dropt something of
giving <em>her</em> a security on your Estate. That method, which could
not be attended with any risk or inconvenience to yourself, would
perhaps be most agreable to all parties. I most sincerely hope that
the sale may be already dispatched by private contract, before the
decisive 18th of February. Why should you confine yourself to
so short a day, since the town is equally full in March and April?
and you are sensible how much the failure of the auction would
blast any other operations. Is it yet too late for a delay? I
mean only of some weeks, for I am very desirous of terminating
this winter, in the <em>present</em> prosperous state of the Country: and
indeed so desirous that I could patiently submit to a much larger
abatement, to be at last possessed of a much better income free
from those accidents and deductions to which land is so woefully
exposed. You talk of £18,000, but if you could not get more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
than 17 or even 16, I might afterwards repent your refusal. I
would certainly vest part in a mortgage, but I would rather chuse
my man and my county, and should like to have the security of
a larger estate than that of Buriton. While such an one was
looking for, the part of the purchase money not secured to Mrs.
G. might lye safely in the funds.</p>

<p>I have not heard from either of the old Ladies, and wish you
could inform yourself of the state of the Northamptonshire Saint.
If you will apply to my good friend Lord Spencer, he could
easily find you a correspondent in that neighbourhood who without
noise or scandal might send you regular and early notice of her
decline and fall.&mdash;On smaller matters you are too earnest and
almost angry: the continuance of the foreign papers I could not
foresee and will try to rectify. Jones's bill, a trifle of about ten
pounds, I will settle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Had I the least idea of the 25 guineas of the Royal society,
I should not have solicited so useless a title: but the dye is now
cast, and I will write to Elmsley to satisfy that demand as well as
the Antiquarian and African. I certainly did not give him any
orders about newspapers, magazines, &amp;c., as I cannot devise any
method of getting them in any reasonable time without an
extravagant expence. Your copiousness on my affairs makes you
concise on those of the public. The debates and the outside
transactions I can read in English and foreign papers, but from
you, as Cicero says to his friend C&oelig;lius (ad familiares, L. ii. Ep. 8)
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nec præterita nec præsentia, sed ut ab homine longe in posterum
prospiciente futura exspecto, ut ex tuis litteris, cum formam Rei
publicæ viderim, quale ædificium futurum sit scire possim</i>. Above
all I wish to hear what part you are likely yourself to act in the
new regency, your hopes, your wishes, and whether you intend
next winter to breathe the free and pleasant air of Lausanne or
to tug at the parliamentary and official oar, amid the fogs of
London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEYVERDUN'S SECOND ATTACK.</div>

<p>Of my book I have not leisure or inclination to talk. Its

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>Immediately on my return to this place, I wrote to
inform you of my safe arrival: but some months have now
elapsed without hearing from you. I should not have patiently
acquiesced under this silence, had I not in the mean time obtained,
through the channel of Mrs. Holroyd and Lord Sheffield,
such frequent and authentic information as gave me tolerable
though not perfect satisfaction on the very interesting subject of
your health and happiness. With regard to my own I have no
reason to complain. I have supported without inconvenience
the short but severe cold of this winter; the gout has not yet
invaded my tranquillity, and I again enjoy the life of society
and study which renders Lausanne so agreable to my taste. The
heaviest drawback is the state of poor Deyverdun. Besides a
gradual and visible decline he has had two strokes of an Apoplexy,
and as these dreadful warnings cannot teach him a lesson of
temperance, his physicians do not allow me to entertain a hope
of his recovery.</p>

<p>My desire to get rid of Buriton is much confirmed by a very
disagreable proof of the danger of distant and landed property.
Hugonin is just dead, and dead insolvent: his real estate is
entailed on his brother, his personals will not satisfy his bond
creditors, and as he had given receipts to my tenants down to
Michaelmas last, I must lose without hopes of redress the rent
and arrears of a year and a half. An heavy and unseasonable
loss! Yet notwithstanding my ardour to shake off the incumbrance,
I have made it my first condition with Lord Sheffield that
in the progress of the business he shall obtain not only your legal
consent, but your free and chearful approbation. Since you dislike
a mortgage, the security of your jointure may be transferred to
an adequate part of the purchase money, vested in the funds, or if
you prefer land I am persuaded that Lord S. will not refuse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
broad basis of his Sussex estate. May you long enjoy an income
which I have often wished it were in my power to enlarge to the
full measure of my affection.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you soon; if writing be inconvenient, I am
persuaded that Mrs. or Miss Gould would discharge with pleasure
the office of secretary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SALE OF BERITON.</div>

<p>*Before your letter, which I received yesterday, I was in the
anxious situation of a King, who hourly expects a courier from
his general, with the news of a decisive engagement. I had
abstained from writing, for fear of dropping a word, or betraying
a feeling, which might render you too cautious or too bold.
On the famous 8th of April, between twelve and two, I reflected
that the business was determined; and each succeeding day I
computed the speedy approach of your messenger, with favourable
or melancholy tidings. When I broke the seal I expected to read,
"What a damned unlucky fellow you are! Nothing tolerable
was offered, and I indignantly withdrew the estate." I <em>did</em>
remember the fate of poor Lenborough, and I was afraid of your
magnanimity, &amp;c.* Well, then, I have £16,000 pounds instead of
Buriton! upon the whole I rejoyce in the exchange, although the
sum has fallen short of our expectations, and I feel the weight of
the reasons which kept it down. But if Lord Stawell was the
only bidder, why in God's name could he not make the same offer
by private contract, and save me the expences of the Auction,
which I fear are considerable? Pray who pays the tax, the buyer
or the seller, and what deduction will occur on the gross sum?</p>

<p>What I am specially pleased with is the character of the purchaser,
or rather of his agent, whom I still suppose to be my old
acquaintance, Mr. Sainsbury, a man of sense, experience, and a fair
reputation. He was bred an Attorney at Petersfield, knows every
inch of the estate, and would not have suffered his Lord to purchase
without having the money, or to give a price above the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
value. From him we shall have no captious difficulties or evasive
delays&mdash;he will be content with a fair title, and I flatter myself
that the whole business will be terminated with ease and despatch.
But as many things fall out between the cup and the lip, your
friendship I am sure will not be asleep, you will goad the slow-paced
lawyers, and settle Mrs. G.'s security for her jointure in the
manner most convenient and agreable for herself. By what time
do you probably suppose that I may have the money in my pocket?
It would be generous, too generous perhaps, in Lord S. and his
agent, if they would make the payment and take possession of the
estate on your act and guarantee without waiting for the return
of the writings from Lausanne. I have sketched a short paper
which you may shew them if you think it will be of any use.</p>

<p>*It is whimsical enough, but it is in human nature, that I now
begin to think of the deep-rooted foundations of land, and the airy
fabrick of the funds. I not only consent, but even wish, to have
eight or ten thousand pounds on a good mortgage; but I think
the whole of that sum too large for Buriton, and conceive that
Lord Stawell should reinforce it by some collateral security.* How
often have I regretted my dear New-river share which the Goslings
so rudely tore from me. I should not be unwilling to repurchase
it for the same money, I mean instead of the mortgage.&mdash;I forgot
to say, indeed it is needless, that I suppose all proper care has been
taken about a deposit, and to secure my receipt of the rents till
the payment of the money. A propos of the rents, half a year is
now due since that worthy general discharge of last Michaelmas,
and I desire that Andrews may instantly exact it, it will be a
seasonable supply, and if Heartfee suffers any inconvenience it will
be no more than a just punishment for his scandalous and manifest
collusion with poor Hugonin, whose merits I am more inclined to
remember than his faults.</p>

<p>Mrs. G[ibbon] of Cliffe has not answered my letters, and I
am anxious to learn the state of her health. Her correspondent in
town is Mr. Law, I know not of what trade, in Sun Court, Cornhill
or Cheapside: if you call on him in one of your morning
walks you may gain and transmit some information.&mdash;When you
see your Madeira friends (is not his name Millighan?) of John
Street, pray thank him in my name; the wine proves excellent, it
is a credit to my table, and a comfort to my health. I want a pipe
that he can answer for, and as bottles almost double the expence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
I think it should be packed carefully in a double cask, and sent
with all convenient speed to Messieurs Romberg at Ostend, the
greatest voituriers in Europe: they must be instructed to forward
it with all proper precaution to their correspondent at Basil or
Basle in Switzerland, who must keep it safe till he has received
from me a permit for its admission into the Canton of Berne,
which I shall be able to send beforehand if Messieurs Romberg
inform me of his name and direction. For want of such a permit
my former wine *was seized, and would have been confiscated, if the
Government of Berne had not treated me with the most flattering
and distinguished civility: they not only released the wine, but
they paid out of their own pocket the shares to which the Bailiff
and the informer were entitled by law. I should not forget that
the Bailiff refused to accept of his part.</p>

<p>Poor Deyverdun's constitution is quite broken; he has had
two or three attacks, not so violent as the first: every time the
door is hastily opened, I expect to hear of some fatal accident:
the best or worst hopes of the Physicians are only that he may
linger some time longer; but, if he lives till the summer, they
propose sending him to some mineral waters at Aix, in Savoy.
You will be glad to hear that I am now assured of possessing,
during my life, this delightful house and garden. The act has
been <em>lately</em> executed in the best form, and the handsomest manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECOVERY OF GEORGE III.</div>

<p>I know not what to say of your miracles at home: we rejoyce
in the king's recovery, and its ministerial consequences; and I
cannot be insensible to the hope, at least the chance, of seeing
in this Country a first Lord of trade, or Secretary at War. In
your answer, which I shall impatiently expect, you will give
me a full and true account of your designs, which by this time
must have droppt, or be determined at least, for the present

<p>I embrace My Lady with warm affection, and still cherish the
firm intention of writing to her soon. But the Dame pays more
attention to the Epistles which she does not, than to those which
she does, receive. At her request Madame de Severy wrote her a
long letter about the two <em>Tufts</em> and many other important matters,
and Mademoiselle at my desire added a scrap for Mademoiselle.
They begin to wonder at her silence, and accuse the negligence
of the post. By her correspondence with Severy I rejoyce to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that the clouds are dispelled, and hope that she leads Maria into
the winter pleasures of the World.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, June 13, 1789.
</p>

<p>*You are in truth a wise, active, indefatigable, and inestimable
friend; and as our virtues are often connected with our faults, if
you were more tame and placid, you would be perhaps of less use
and value. A very important and difficult transaction seems to
be nearly terminated with success and mutual satisfaction: we
seem to run before the wind with a prosperous gale; and, unless
we should strike on some secret rocks, which I do not foresee, we
shall, on or before the 31st July, enter the harbour of content;
though I cannot pursue the metaphor by adding we shall <em>land</em>,
since our operation is of the very opposite tendency. I could
not easily forgive myself for shutting you up in a dark room with
parchments and attornies, did I not reflect that this probably is
the last material trouble that you will ever have on my account;
and that, after the labours and delays of near twenty years, I shall
at last attain what I have always sighed for, a clear and competent
income, above my wants, and equal to my wishes. In this contemplation
you will be sufficiently rewarded. I hope Sainsbury
will be content with our title-deeds, for I cannot furnish another
shred of parchment.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANXIETY FOR HIS STEPMOTHER.</div>

<p>What difficulty can arise about our family Wills? My
father made none, and I took out letters of administration as
heir at law: my grandfather's may be found at the Commons
for a shilling: but it is not worth that shilling, since I joyned
on coming of age with my father to cut off the entail. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
fine and recovery (in the year 1758) are doubtless registered
in the proper courts. I as little understand the want of my
father's marriage settlement. With his first wife? she has been
dead above forty years, and I am her sole representative. With
his second, the present Mrs. Gibbon? From her it may be easily
procured, and you are not ignorant that *her jointure of £200
a year is secured on the Buriton estate, and that her legal consent
is requisite for the sale. Again and again I must repeat my hope
that she is perfectly satisfied, and that the close of her life may
not be embittered by suspicion, or fear, or discontent. What new
security does she prefer,&mdash;the funds, the mortgage, or your land?
At all events she must be made easy. I wrote to her again some
time ago, and begged that if she were too weak to write, she
would desire Mrs. Gould or Mrs. Holroyd to give me a line concerning
her state of health. To this no answer; I am afraid she
is displeased.* By the channel of Mrs. H. you might convey some
idea of my <em>real</em> anxiety.</p>

<p>The Saint seems ripe for heaven: could you not learn from
Law, what people are about her, and what measures can be
taken to have the earliest intelligence of her departure to prevent
a Will being secreted, &amp;c.? Yet I am her heir-at-law.</p>

<p>*Now for the disposal of the money: I approve of the £8000
mortgage on Buriton; and honour your prudence in not showing
them, by the comparison of the rent and interest, how foolish it
is to purchase land.* If you can obtain from Lord S[tawell] the
four and a half, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant mieux</i>. In case you cannot, I will suggest an
odd but I think a rational scheme. Let four and a half, or rather
five per cent. be stipulated in the mortgage deed, with a proviso
in a separate act that, as long as the interest shall be paid on or
before the day appointed, I will be satisfied with four per cent. As
long as Lord S. is punctual (and this will be a stimulus) he will
pay no more; and should I ever be forced by his neglect to transfer
the mortgage, which will, I suppose, be in my power, I shall easily
find a substitute at the advanced interest. For how many years
do I lend? Do I reserve a right of putting in my own receiver?
Six thousand more will be vested in the three per cents, and if
Mrs. G. chuses them, that sum will not be too large a basis for her
jointure of £200 a year. The additional hundred which I pay
her is a separate account. The remainder, between two and three
thousand, may be trusted to private security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Did you wish for the whole, or part, or more? it is perfectly
at your service; but as you are indifferent, I write to you in the
third person.</p>

<p>"I have some knowledge of the Lord Sheffield whom you
mention, and though he is poor, I believe him to be honest, and
I should therefore prefer his four and a half regularly paid at
Gosling's, without trouble or application, to a more doubtful five
per cent. which might perhaps be found on bond security."</p>

<p>But I had rather wait some weeks before I absolutely determine,
as *there is a chance of my drawing the greatest part of
the sum into this country, for an arrangement which you yourself
must approve, but which I have not time to explain at present.
For the sake of dispatching, by this evening's post, an answer to
your letter which arrived this morning, I confine myself to the
<em>needful</em>, but in the course of a few days I <em>will</em> dictate to Severy
a more familiar Epistle. I embrace, &amp;c. Adieu. Ever yours.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, July 14, 1789.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF DEYVERDUN.</div>

<p>*Poor Deyverdun is no more: He expired Saturday the 4th
instant: and in his unfortunate situation, death could only be
viewed by himself, and his friend, in the light of a consummation
devoutly to be wished for. Since September he has had a dozen
Apoplectic strokes, more or less violent: in the intervals between
them his strength gradually decayed; every principle of life was
exhausted; and had he continued to drag a miserable existence,
he must probably have survived the loss of his faculties. Of all
misfortunes this was what he himself most apprehended: but his
reason was clear and calm to the last; he beheld his approaching
dissolution with the firmness of a philosopher. I fancied that
time and reflection had prepared me for the event; but the habits
of three-and-thirty years' friendship are not so easily broken.
The first days, and more especially the first nights, were indeed
painful. Last Wednesday and Saturday it would not have been
in my power to write. I must now recollect myself, since it is
necessary for me not only to impart the news, but to ask your
opinion on a very serious and doubtful question, which must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
decided without loss of time. I shall state the facts, but as I am
on the spot and as new lights may occur, I do not promise implicit
obedience.</p>

<p>Had my poor friend died without a Will, a female <em>first</em> cousin
settled somewhere in the north of Germany, and whom I believe
he had never seen, would have been his heir at law. In the next
degree he had several cousins; and one of these, an old companion,
by name Mr. de Montagny, he has chosen for his heir. As this
house and garden was the best and clearest part of poor Deyverdun's
fortune; as there is an heavy duty or fine (what they call
<em>Lods</em>) on every change of property out of the legal descent; as
Montagny has a small estate and a large family, it was necessary
to make some provision in his favour. The will therefore leaves
me the option of enjoying this place during my life, on paying
the sum of £250 (I reckon in English money) at present, and an
annual rent of £30; or else of purchasing the house and garden
for a sum which, including the duty, will amount to £2500. If
I value the rent of £30 at twelve years' purchase, I may acquire
my enjoyment for life at about the rate of £600; and the
remaining £1900 will be the difference between that tenure and
absolute perpetual property. As you have never accused me of
too ardent a zeal for the interest of posterity, you will easily guess
which scale at first preponderated. I deeply felt the advantage of
acquiring, for the smaller sum, every possible enjoyment, as long
as I myself should be capable of enjoying: I rejected, with scorn,
the idea of giving £1900 for ideal posthumous property; and I
deemed it of little moment whose name, after my death, should
be inscribed on my house and garden at Lausanne. How often
did I repeat to myself the philosophical lines of Pope, which seem
to determine the question:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">Pray Heaven, cries Swift, it last as you go on;</div>
<div class="line">I wish to God this house had been your own.</div>
<div class="line">Pity to build without or son or wife:</div>
<div class="line">Why, you'll enjoy it <em>only</em> all your life.</div>
<div class="line">Well, if the use be mine, does it concern one,</div>
<div class="line">Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?</div>
</div></div>

<p>In this state of self-satisfaction I was not much disturbed by
the unanimous advice of all my real or nominal friends, who
exhort me to prefer the right of purchase: among such friends,
some are careless and some are ignorant; and the judgment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
those, who are able and willing to form an opinion, is often
byassed by some selfish or social affection, by some visible or
invisible interest. But my own reflections have gradually and
forcibly driven me from my first propensity; and those reflections
I will now proceed to enumerate:</p>

<p>1. I can make this purchase with ease and prudence. As I
have had the pleasure of <em>not</em> hearing from you very lately, I flatter
myself that you advance on a carpet-road, and that almost by the
receipt of this letter (July the 31st) the acres of Buriton will be
transmuted into Sixteen thousand pounds: If the payment be not
absolutely compleated by that day, Sainsbury will not scruple, I
suppose, depositing the £2500 at Gosling's, to meet my draught.
Should he hesitate, I can desire Darrel to sell off <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum sufficit</i>
of my short annuities. As soon as the new settlement of my
affairs is made, I shall be able, after deducting this sum, to square
my expence to my income.* The decay of the Belvidere<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> <em>must</em>
place me in easy, and the bounty of the Cliffe<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> <em>may</em> establish me
in affluent circumstance. If this Lausanne purchase should seem
a violent measure, at the worst I can make Cadell repay me the
money in three or four years. I am revolving the means. I am
beginning to be a rich man.</p>

<p>*2. On mature consideration, I am perhaps less selfish or less
philosophical than I appear at first sight: Indeed, were I not
so, it would now be in my power to turn my fortune into life-annuities,
and let the Devil take the hindmost. I feel, (perhaps
it is foolish,) but I feel that this little paradise will please me still
more when it is absolutely my own; and that I shall be encouraged
in every improvement of use or beauty, by the prospect that, after
my departure, it will be enjoyed by some person of my own choice.
I sometimes reflect with pleasure that my writings will survive
me: and that idea is at least as vain and chimerical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"FIERCE AND ERECT, A FREE MASTER."</div>

<p>3. The heir, Mr. de Montagny, is an old acquaintance* of mine.
I <em>believe</em> him to be a man of honour: but I <em>know</em> him to be a man
of a passionate quarrelsome disputatious temper. *My situation of
a life-holder is rather new and singular in this country: the laws
have not provided for many nice cases which may arise between
the Landlord and tenant: some I can foresee, others have been
suggested, many more I might feel when it would be too late.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
His right of property might plague and confine me: he might
forbid my lending to a friend, inspect my conduct, check my
improvements, call for securities, repairs, &amp;c. But if I purchase,
I walk on my own terrace, fierce and erect, the free master of one
of the most delicious spots on the Globe.*</p>

<p>4. You will perhaps think £2500 a very smart price for a
moderate house and three or four acres of land (I fancy that is
about the measure). You will be much more surprized to hear
that poor Deyverdun has valued it in my favour at least £1000
below the real value and market price. Of this I must inform
myself more correctly, but I am much inclined to believe it, from
the general opinion, from the comparison of other sales and
purchases, from the peculiar merits of the situation, and from the
scarcity of ground. If it were divided into three houses and
gardens and sold to builders, I know not what it would produce.</p>

<p>*Should I ever migrate homewards, (You stare, but such an
event is less improbable than I could have thought it two years
ago,) this place would be disputed by strangers and natives, and
the difference would perhaps clear the expences of my removal.</p>

<p>Weigh these reasons, and send me without delay a rational,
explicit opinion, to which I shall pay such regard as the nature of
circumstances will allow. But, alas! when all is determined, I
shall possess this house, by whatsoever tenure, without friendship
or domestic society. I did not imagine, six years ago, that a plan
of life so congenial to my wishes, would so speedily vanish. I
cannot write upon any other subject. Adieu, yours ever.*</p>

<p class="head">
July 22nd, 1789.
</p>

<p>Am I not an exact man! The power is executed, attested,
and dispatched the same day (July 22) on which it was received.
The appearance of liberality confirms my belief that we are
transacting with a fair willing purchaser, and inclines me to hope
that the small defects of deeds will be supplied or excused.
Surely a great part of our strict formalities is calculated for the
emolument of the lawyers rather than the security of the parties.
In this simple country we are far less rigid, and a quiet possession
of some years (all mortgages are registered) is admitted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a sufficient title. But at all events, as this letter will not reach
you before the third or fourth of next month, I see that the
day of payment will be postponed beyond the 31st of July.
Before this time you will have received, weighed and answered
my important missive of the 15th. I am still in a state of doubt
and suspense from which your opinion may possibly relieve me,
but I must know whether, in case of farther delay, Sainsbury will
advance the £2500, or rather £2800, and whether I may draw on
the Goslings, from whom I must never expect any favour.</p>

<p>You say nothing of the Belvidere. Have you her legal
acquiescence? What security has she chosen? I think she
cannot last very long, but I should be hurt if her last days were
embittered by any fears or scruples. As to the money destined
for the funds you had better consult with David. He is friendly
and knowing.</p>

<p>I embrace my lady, but no longer dare talk of writing to her.
Maria must now be in all the glories of Lewes races. At Severy's
we often talk of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">famille</i>. I rejoyce in the Douglas match:
it is just such a wife as I should chuse,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> but I hope she will still
live with her father.&mdash;Is your picture on the road? Mine shall
set out whenever you please. Are you not amazed at the French
revolution? They have the power, will they have the moderation
to establish a good constitution? Adieu.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, July 25th, 1789.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFECTIVE TITLE TO BERITON.</div>

<p>*After receiving and dispatching the power of attorney, last
Wednesday, I opened, with some palpitation, the unexpected
missive which arrived this morning. The perusal of the contents
spoiled my breakfast: they are disagreeable in themselves, alarming
in their consequences, and peculiarly unpleasant at the present
moment, when I hoped to have formed and secured the arrangements
of my future life. I do not perfectly understand what are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
these deeds which are so inflexibly required; the wills and
marriage-settlements I have sufficiently answered. But your
arguments do not convince Sainsbury, and I have very little
hope from the Lenborough search. What will be the event?
If his objections are only the result of legal scrupulosity, surely
they might be removed, and every chink might be filled, by a general
bond of indemnity, in which I boldly ask you to joyn, as it will be
a substantial important act of friendship, without any possible
risk to yourself or your successors. Should he still remain
obdurate, I must believe what I already suspect, that Lord Stawell
repents of his purchase, and wishes to elude the conclusion. Our
case would be then hopeless, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibi omnis effusus labor</i>, and the
Estate would be returned on our hands with the taint of a bad
title. The refusal of mortgage does not please me; but surely
our offer shows some confidence in the goodness of my title. If
he will not take £8000 at <em>four per cent.</em> we must look out elsewhere;
new doubts and delays will arise, and I am persuaded that you
will not place an implicit confidence in Woodcock or any other
Attorney. I know not as yet your opinion about my Lausanne
purchase.</p>

<p>If you are against it, the present posture of affairs gives
you great advantage, &amp;c., &amp;c.* The purchase money of Buriton
will not be paid in time. Sainsbury, if false, will not advance
a shilling, and with the prospect of living or rather starving
on a landed estate, I cannot afford to sell out £2500 of my short
annuities. For my own part I hang in suspense, but if the
money could be easily found I rather incline to the <em>property</em> as
simple and beneficial.</p>

<p>I am ignorant of your picture: mine shall depart by the
first proper occasion: but should not some precautions be taken
with regard to duties? the importation of foreign pictures is
heavily taxed, but a work of Sir Joshua's may surely return home.</p>

<p>*The Severys are all well; an uncommon circumstance for
the four persons of the family at once. They are now at Mex
(pronounce May), a country-house six miles from hence, which
I visit to-morrow for two or three days: they often come to
town, and we shall contrive to pass a part of the Autumn together
at Rolle. I want to change the scene; and beautiful as the
garden and prospect must appear to every eye, I feel that the
state of my own mind casts a gloom over them; every spot, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
walk, every bench, recalls the memory of those hours, of those
conversations, which will return no more. But I tear myself
from the subject. I could not help writing to-day, though I do
not find I have said any thing very material. As you must be
conscious that you have agitated me, you will not postpone any
agreeable, or even <em>decisive</em> intelligence. I almost hesitate,
whether I shall not run over to England, to consult with you on
the spot, and to fly from poor Deyverdun's shade, which meets me
at every turn. I did not expect to have felt it so sharply. But
six hundred miles! why are we so far off?</p>

<p>Once more, what is the difficulty of the title? Will men of
sense, in a sensible Country, never get rid of the tyranny of
lawyers? more oppressive and ridiculous than even the old yoke
of the Clergy. Is not a term of seventy or eighty years, near
twenty in my own person, sufficient to prove our legal possession?
Will not the record of fines and recoveries attest that <em>I</em> am free
from any bar of entails and settlements? Consult some Sage of
the Law, whether their present demand be necessary and legal.
If our ground be firm, force them to execute the agreement or
forfeit the deposit. But if, as I much fear, they have a right,
and a wish, to elude the consummation, would it not be better to
release them at once, than to be hung up five years, as in the case
of Lovegrove, which cost me in the end four or five thousand
pounds? You are bold, you are wise; consult, resolve, act.</p>

<p>In my penultimate letter I dropped a strange hint, that a
migration homeward was not impossible. I know not what to say;
my mind is all afloat; yet you will not reproach me with caprice
or inconstancy. How many years did you damn my scheme of
retiring to Lausanne! I executed that plan; I found as much
happiness as is compatible with human nature, and during four
years (1783-1787) I never breathed a sigh of repentance. On
my return from England the scene was changed: I found only a
faint semblance of Deyverdun, and that semblance was each day
fading from my sight. I have passed an anxious year, but my
anxiety is now at an end, and the prospect before me is a melancholy
solitude. I am still deeply rooted in this country; the
possession of this paradise, the friendship of the Severys, a mode
of society suited to my taste, and the enormous trouble and
<em>expence</em> of a migration. Yet in England (when the present clouds
are dispelled) I could form a very comfortable establishment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
London, or rather at Bath; and I have a very noble country-seat
about ten miles from East Grinstead in Sussex.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> That spot
is dearer to me than the rest of the three kingdoms; and I have
sometimes wondered how two men, so opposite in their tempers
and pursuits, should have imbibed so long and lively a propensity
for each other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IDEA OF ADOPTING CHARLOTTE PORTEN.</div>

<p>Sir Stanier Porten<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> is just dead. He has left his widow
with a small pension, and two children, my nearest relations:
the eldest, Charlotte, is about Louisa's age, and one of the most
amiable, sensible young creatures I ever saw. I have conceived
a romantic idea of educating and adopting her; as we
descend into the vale of years, our infirmities require some
domestic female society: Charlotte would be the comfort of my
age, and I could reward her care and tenderness with a decent
fortune. A thousand difficulties oppose the execution of this
plan, which I have never opened but to you; yet it would be less
impracticable in England than in Switzerland. Adieu. I am
wounded, pour some oil into my wounds: Yet I am less unhappy
since I have thrown my mind upon paper. Adieu, ever yours.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, Sept. 9, 1789.
</p>

<p>*Within an hour after the reception of your last, I drew my
pen for the purpose of a reply, and my exordium ran in the
following words: "I find by experience, that it is much more
rational, as well as easy, to answer a letter of real business by the
return of the post." This important truth is again verified by my
own example. After writing three pages I was called away by a
very rational motive, and the post departed before I could return
to the conclusion. A second delay was coloured by some decent
pretence: three weeks have slipped away, and I now force myself
on a task, which I should have dispatched without an effort on
the first summons. My only excuse is, that I had little to write
about English business, and that I could write nothing definitive
about my Swiss affairs. And first, as Aristotle says, of the first,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>1. I was indeed in low spirits when I sent what you so justly
style my dismal letter; but I do assure you, that my own feelings
contributed much more to sink me, than any events or terrors
relative to the sale of Buriton. But I again hope and trust, from
your consolatory epistle, that* the purchasers are willing and
honest, that the deeds have been produced or excused, and that
on or before the reception of this despatch (alas, it will be the
23rd perhaps of September) the money has been paid. In all
this I must be passive, but with regard to Mrs. Gibbon's, before it
is again vested, I am sure she will be satisfied with your security, as
mine on the stock which I already hold would require new powers
of Attorney, and must be productive of fresh delay. But it is a
whimsical circumstance in my fate, that I happen to receive the
largest sum which can ever fall to my lot at the time, when money
is the most plenty and consequently bears the lowest value, when
good mortgages are so difficult to be found, and when the funds
scarcely yield four per cent. interest. I wish Lord Stawell would
take the £8000 on Buriton even at four per cent., perhaps his
proud stomach may be come down. Should he still disdain it, I
listen with pleasure and gratitude to the proposal of your Yorkshire
mortgage on the same terms, though in general it is more
advisable for friends to abstain from any pecuniary concerns with
each other. If you no longer adhere to that idea, some sound
good mortgage, if possible in a register county, must be found,
and I would even stretch the loan to £10,000, in which case my
property would be nearly divided between landed and monied
security without reckoning my copper share or my poor annuity
in the French funds. In the meanwhile, that the portion destined
to the mortgage may not lye dead, I suppose with you that there
is nothing more commodious than India-bonds. Will you consult
Darrel?</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE-INTEREST IN DEYVERDUN'S HOUSE.</div>

<p>*2. My Swiss transaction has suffered a great alteration. I
shall not become the proprietor of my house and garden at
Lausanne, and I relinquish the fantom with more regret than
you could easily imagine. But I have been determined by a
difficulty, which at first appeared of little moment, but which has
gradually swelled to an alarming magnitude. There is a law in
this country, as well as in some provinces of France, which is
styled "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le droit de retrait, le retrait lignager</i>" (Lord Loughborough
must have heard of it), by which the relations of the deceased are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
entitled to redeem an house or estate at the price for which it has
been sold; and as the sum fixed by poor Deyverdun is much
below its known value, a crowd of competitors are beginning to
start. The best opinions (for they are divided) are in my favour,
that I am not subject to "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">the droit de retrait</i>," since I take not as
a purchaser, but as a legatee. But the words of the Will are
somewhat ambiguous, the event of law is always uncertain, the
administration of justice at Berne (the last appeal) depends too
much on favour and intrigue; and it is very doubtful whether I
could revert to the life-holding, after having chosen and lost the
property. These considerations engaged me to open a negotiation
with Mr. de Montagny, through the medium of my friend the
Judge; and as he most ardently wishes to keep the house, he
consented, though with some reluctance, to my proposals. Yesterday
he signed a covenant in the most regular and binding form,
by which he allows my power of transferring my interest, interprets
in the most ample sense my right of making alterations, and
expressly renounces all claim, as landlord, of visiting or inspecting
the premisses. I have promised to lend him 12,000 Livres,
(between seven and eight hundred pounds), secured on the house
and land. The mortgage is four times its value; the interest at
four per cent. will be annually discharged by the rent of thirty
guineas, and I shall have an additional hold on his good behaviour.
So that I am now tranquil on that score for the remainder of my
days. I hope that time will gradually reconcile me to the place
which I have inhabited with my poor friend; for in spite of the
<em>cream</em> of London, I am still persuaded that no other residence is
so well adapted to my taste and habits of studious and social life.</p>

<p>Far from delighting in the whirl of a Metropolis, my only
complaint against Lausanne is the great number of strangers,
always of English, and now of French, by whom we are infested
in summer. Yet we have escaped the <em>damned</em> great ones, the
Count d'Artois,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> the Polignacs,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> &amp;c. who slip by us to Turin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
What a scene is France! While the assembly is voting abstract
propositions, Paris is an independent Republic; the provinces
have neither authority nor freedom, and poor Necker<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> declares
that credit is no more, and that the people refuse to pay taxes.
Yet I think you must be seduced by the abolition of tythes. If
Eden goes to Paris you may have some curious <em>confidential</em>
information. Give me some account of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas;
do they live with Lord North? I hope they do. When will
parliament be dissolved? Are you still Coventry mad? I
embrace My Lady, the stately Maria, and the smiling Louisa.
Alas! Alas! you will never come to Switzerland. Adieu, ever
yours.*</p>

<div class="line">*Alas! what perils do environ</div>
<div class="line">The man who meddles with cold iron.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Alas! what delays and difficulties do attend the man who
meddles with legal and landed business! yet if it be only to
disappoint your expectation, I am not so very nervous at this
new provoking obstacle. I had totally forgotten the deed in
question, which was contrived by the two trustees to tye his
hands and regulate the disorder of his affairs (in the last year of
my father's life); and which might have been so easily cancelled
by Sir Stanier, who had not the smallest interest in it, either for
himself or his family. The amicable suit which is now become
necessary must, I think, be short and unambiguous, yet I cannot
help dreading the crotchets that lurk under the Chancellor's great
wig; and, at all events, I foresee some additional delay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
expence. The golden pill of the £2800 has soothed my discontent;
and if it be safely lodged with the Goslings, I agree with you in
considering it as an unequivocal pledge of a fair and willing
purchaser. It is, indeed, chiefly in that light that I now rejoyce
in so large a deposit, which is no longer necessary in its full
extent. You are apprized by my last letter that I have reduced
myself to the life enjoyment of the house and garden, and, in
spite of my feelings, I am every day more convinced that I have
chosen the safer side. I believe my cause to have been good, but
it was doubtful: law in this country is not so expensive as in
England, but it is more troublesome. I must have gone to Bern,
have solicited my Judges in person&mdash;a vile custom! the event
was doubtful, and during at least two years, I should have been
in a state of suspense and anxiety: till the conclusion of which it
would have been madness to have attempted any alteration or
improvement.</p>

<p>According to my present arrangement I shall want no more
than eleven hundred pounds of the £2000, and I suppose you
will direct Gosling to lay out the remainder in East India
bonds, that it may not lye quite dead, while I am accountable
to Sainsbury for the interest.* I presume that I am entitled
till the consummation to the rents of Buriton: a little drop of
honey is collected from Lady-day to Michaelmas, and Andrews
is I hope instructed to squeeze the bag without delay or mercy:
the Tenant deserves none.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AUTHORITY OF BLACKSTONE.</div>

<p>*The elderly Lady in a male habit, who informed me that
Yorkshire is a register County, is a certain Judge, one Sir
William Blackstone, whose name you may possibly have heard.
After stating the danger of purchasers and creditors, with
regard to the title of estates on which they lay out or lend
their money, he thus continues: "In Scotland every act and
event regarding the transmission of property is regularly entered
on record; And some of our own provincial divisions, particularly
the <em>extended county of York</em> and the populous county
of Middlesex, have prevailed with the Legislature to erect such
registers in their respective districts." (Blackstone's Commentaries,
Vol. ii. p. 343, Edition of 1774, in quarto.) If I am
mistaken, it is in pretty good company; but I suspect that we are
all right, and that the register is confined to one or two Ridings.
As we have, alas! two or three months before us, I should hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
that your prudent sagacity will discover some sound land, in case
you should not have time to arrange your own Mortgage.</p>

<p>I now write in a hurry, as I am just setting out for Rolle, where
I shall be settled with cook and servants in a pleasant apartment
till the middle of November. The Severys have a house there,
where they pass the Autumn. I am not sorry to vary the scene for
a few weeks, and I wish to be absent while some alterations are
making in my house at Lausanne. I wish the change of air may
be of service to Severy the father, but we do not at all like his
present state of health. How compleatly, alas, how compleatly!
could I now lodge you: but your firm resolve of making me
a visit seems to have vanished like a dream. Next summer you
will not find five hundred pounds for a rational friendly expedition:
and should parliament be dissolved, you will perhaps find
five thousand for ****. I cannot think of it with patience.
Pray take serious strenuous measures for sending me a pipe of
excellent Madeira in cask, with some dozens of Malmsey Madeira.
It should be consigned to Messrs. Romberg, Voituriers, at
Ostend, and I must have timely notice of its march. We have
so much to say about France, that I suppose we shall never say
anything. That country is now in a state of <em>dissolution</em>. Adieu.*</p>

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, December 5th, 1789.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>I need not repeat what we have both so often felt and
acknowledged, that between us silence is never the effect of
coldness or forgetfulness, yet when I recollect that your second
letter is still unanswered, a conscious blush rises to my cheek.
Our mutual friendship we have no occasion to express, of our
health and situation we may have frequent accounts by the channel
of Lord Sheffield and Mrs. Holroyd; mere topics of Epistolary
conversation do not readily occur between distant friends, but you
ask me some questions of an interesting nature and your kind
curiosity it is incumbent on me to satisfy.</p>

<p>The disposal of Buriton I think you cannot disapprove. A
distant landed estate is the worst kind of property, and you will
not be surprized to hear that after the payment of every expence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and every deduction, the remainder of the clear income was little
more than sufficient for the annual supply, which I hope will be
long, very long, offered to the Belvidere at Bath. The neglect,
I will not give it an harsher name, of Hugonin cost me last year
above seven hundred pounds; yet after his death, where could I
have found a more creditable agent? At sixteen thousand pounds
Lord Sheffield does not think Buriton ill sold, especially as four
or five thousand more must be added which I had already received
from the sale of Horn and Harris's farms. Some forms of law
have delayed the final conclusion, but I expect to hear every post
of the payment of the money, and you will rejoyce to hear, what
I assure on my honour is true, that every shilling is my own, and
that prudence, without any pressure of distress or debt, is the sole
motive of my conduct. The entire sum I mean to divide between
the stocks and a good mortgage, that at all events I may have a
sound leg to stand upon. I hope you are satisfied with the
arrangement of your jointure: Lord Sheffield cannot forget the
burthen of every one of my letters, "Unless Mrs. G. be safe and
easy, I cannot be so."</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRREPARABLE LOSS OF A FRIEND.</div>

<p>When I had the pleasure of seeing you at Bath two years ago,
you may remember the melancholy account which I gave you of
poor Deyverdun. On my return to Lausanne I found him much
altered for the worse; he was attacked by a succession of Apoplectic
fits, and after a general decay, he died last July, when his life
could be no longer desirable for himself or his friends. The loss
of a friend of five and thirty years is irreparable, and each day I
feel the comfortless solitude to which I am reduced. By his
will he designed that I should possess the delightful house and
garden which I inhabit: and which have not, I believe, their equal
in Europe; by a subsequent arrangement with his heir, in which
both find their advantage, I have secured the free and indisputable
enjoyment for my life, and have already made some agreable and
useful alterations. I still like the people and the country, and
here I shall probably spend the latter season of life, with the
resolution however of visiting England every three or four years.
I have often regretted that your imperfect knowledge of the
French language never allowed me to seduce you to this place.
I am sure you would have pleased and been pleased in the circle
of my familiar acquaintance.</p>

<p>My health was never so good as it is at present, and since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
my unseasonable attack at Bath I have not felt the slightest
return of the gout. You may possibly hear that Mr. Gibbon
has undertaken some new history; be persuaded, if I know his
intentions, that after six weighty quartos, he now reads and
writes for his own amusement, though I will not answer for what
those amusements may one day produce. You may likewise hear
of tumults and rebellions in Switzerland. Be persuaded, that
the popular madness of France and Flanders has not reached
these tranquil regions, and that the Swiss have sense enough to
feel and maintain their own happiness, which is endeared to them
by the disorders of the neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Adieu, Dear Madam; I grieve for you and for myself that we
are now entering into the cold and dreary season, but I sincerely
hope that you will find strength and spirits to lay this and many
other winters at your feet.</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, December 15th, 1789.
</p>

<p>*You have often reason to accuse my strange silence and
neglect in the most important of <em>my own</em> affairs; for I will
presume to assert, that in a business of yours of equal consequence,
you should not find me cold or careless. But on the present
occasion my silence is, perhaps, the highest compliment I ever
paid you. You remember the answer of Philip of Macedon:
"Philip may sleep, while he knows that Parmenio is awake." I
expected, and, to say the truth, I wished that my Parmenio
would have decided and acted, without expecting my dilatory
answer, and in his decision I should have acquiesced with implicit
confidence. But since you will have my opinion, let us consider
the present state of my affairs. In the course of my life I have
often known, and sometimes felt, the difficulty of getting money,
but I now find myself involved in a much more singular distress,
the difficulty of placing it, and if it continues much longer, I
shall almost wish for my land again.</p>

<p>I perfectly agree with you, that it is bad management to
purchase in the funds when they do not yield four per cent.,*<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and I incline every day more and more to the encrease of the
mortgage. I am much mistaken if in my last letter I did not
extend the sum as £10,000 pounds, which would make, as I
remember to have said, about an equal partition of my property.
Can that sum be called, even in your wealthy island, so very inconsiderable?
I would even give somewhat larger latitude (even
as far as £12,000 if I preserve a right of calling in a fourth or a
moiety on reasonable notice). Is it possible that in seven or
eight months no good and clear security can be found, especially
if I am forced to be content with the scanty interest of four per
cent.? Yet I approve your diffidence and caution: in the concerns
of our friends even cowardice is a virtue. The doubtful title of
a mortgage might distress and perplex me for the remainder of
my life, and you would not easily forgive yourself for having
been the innocent author of my calamities. Rather than expose
myself to such a risk, I would try whether some <em>great</em> banker
would not be disposed to give low interest and firm security for
my money till it should be called for, or at all events I would
deposit it in the Bank for six months or a year, and live on the
principal till you could find an unquestionable opportunity of
placing it on landed property. *Some of this money I can place
safely and advantageously by means of my banker here; and I
shall possess, what I have always desired, a command of cash, which
I cannot abuse to my prejudice, since I have it in my power to
supply by my pen any extraordinary or fanciful indulgence of
expence. And so much&mdash;much, indeed&mdash;for pecuniary matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY OF FRANCE.</div>

<p>What would you have me say of the affairs of France? we
are too near, and too remote, to form an accurate judgment of
that wonderful scene. The abuses of the court and government
called aloud for reformation; and it has happened, as it will
always happen, that an innocent, well-disposed prince has paid
the forfeits of the sins of his predecessors; of the ambition of
the Lewis XIV., of the profusion of Lewis XV. The French
nation had a glorious opportunity, but they have abused, and
may lose their advantages. If they had been content with a
liberal translation of our system, if they had respected the prerogatives
of the crown, and the privileges of the Nobles, they
might have raised a solid fabric, on the only true foundation, the
natural Aristocracy of a great Country. How different is the
prospect! Their King brought a captive to Paris, after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
palace had been stained with the blood of his guards; the Nobles
in exile; the Clergy plundered in a way which strikes at the root
of all property; the capital an independent Republic; the union
of the provinces dissolved; the flames of discord kindled by the
worst of men; (in that light I consider Mirabeau;) and the
honestest of the Assembly a set of wild Visionaries, (like our Dr.
Price,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>) who gravely debate, and dream about the establishment
of a pure and perfect democracy of five-and-twenty millions, the
virtues of the golden age, and the primitive rights and equality
of mankind, which would lead, in fair reasoning, to an equal
partition of lands and money. How many years must elapse
before France can recover any vigour, or resume her station
among the powers of Europe! As yet, there is no symptom of
a great man, a Richelieu or a Cromwell, arising, either to restore
the Monarchy, or to lead the Commonwealth. The weight of
Paris, more deeply engaged in the funds than <em>all</em> the rest of the
Kingdom, will long delay a bankrupcy; and if it should happen,
it will be, both in the cause and effect, a measure of weakness,
rather than of strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH EXILES AT LAUSANNE.</div>

<p>You send me to Chamberry, to see a prince and an Archbishop.
Alas! we have exiles enough here, with the Marshal
de Castries<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and the Duke de Guignes<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> at their head: and this
inundation of strangers, which used to be confined to the summer,
will now stagnate all the winter. The only ones whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
seen with pleasure are M. Mounier,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the late president of the

dined with me. Mounier, who is a serious dry politician, is
returned to Dauphiné. Lally is an amiable man of the World,
and a poet: he passes the winter here with his <em>female friend</em>
the Princess d'Hénin.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> You know how much I prefer a quiet
select society to a crowd of names and titles, and that I always
seek conversation with a view to amusement rather than information.
What happy countries are England and Switzerland, if they
know and preserve their happiness.</p>

<p>I have a thousand things to say of My Lady, Maria, and
Louisa, but I can add only a short postscript about the Madeira
and picture.</p>

<p>1. Good Madeira is now become essential to my health and
reputation. May your hogshead prove as good as the last; may
it not be intercepted by the rebels or the Austrians. What a
scene again in that country! Happy England! happy Switzerland!*
I again repeat I must have early notice of my wine's
approach, that I may send a permit to meet it at Basil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>2. To whom did you entrust the picture<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and Rennel's<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> maps?
I have not heard of either. Was it to Elmsley? I have expected
these many months a box of books, &amp;c., which he announced.
Will you not clear up the point? My picture expects a safe
occasion. Adieu.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>550.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, January 27th, 1790.
</p>

<p>*Your two last epistles, of the 7th and 11th instant, were
somewhat delayed on the road; they arrived within two days of
each other, the last this morning, (the 27th); so that I answer
by the first, or at least by the second post. Upon the whole,
your French method, though sometimes more rapid, appears to
me less sure and steady than the old German highway.*</p>

<p>I will not deny (for it was probably too visible) that your
proposal, which arose from the kindest motives, of your Yorkshire
mortgage embarrassed me from the beginning, and whatever faint
signs of acquiescence I may have given, they proceeded from the
apprehension of wounding your honourable feelings by anything
that might bear the appearance of doubt and distrust. I could
not reconcile the two characters of debtor and friend, and I was
shocked by the idea, however distant or unlikely, that in a serious
concern our interests might possibly become opposite to each
other. Your first letter relieved me from that weight, and I
viewed with much less horror the chance of leaving the purchase
money for some time idle and unproductive in the bank: yet I
could not entirely subscribe to your charge that I had changed my
<em>principles</em>. Eight thousand pounds had been always designed for
the mortgage: you object (to my great surprize) that good landed
security cannot easily be found for so <em>small</em> a sum; I agree to
enlarge it; where is the change or contradiction? I confess
however that the very high price of the Stocks has rendered me
less eager for an investment which at present will not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
produce the four per cent., and which rather affords the danger
of a fall than the hopes of a rise. You are likewise inaccurate
when you accuse me of having already drawn near £2000 of the
purchase money.</p>

<p>But enough of these altercations. *A new and brighter prospect
seems to be breaking upon us, and few events of <em>that kind</em> have
ever given me more pleasure than your successful negotiation and
Sainsbury's satisfactory answer. The agreement is, indeed, equally
convenient for both parties: no time or expence will be wasted
in scrutinizing the title of the estate; the interest will be secured
by the clause of five per cent., and I lament with you, that no
larger sum than £8000 can be placed on Beriton, without asking
(what might be somewhat impudent) a collateral security, &amp;c., &amp;c.*
As I do not mean to entrap them, the allowance of a month is
perfectly right and in truth immaterial. As the purchase money
is by this arrangement very much reduced, they will now pay it,
I suppose, whenever you please, and perhaps (you will judge) it
may be as well to consummate on Lady Day, that I may be
entitled to another half year's rent from the Tenant. The power
of calling in the Mortgage, I only meant as a superfluous precaution,
but I suppose there will be some restraint on their paying
it off whenever they please, perhaps at a time inconvenient to the
creditor. After Lord Stawell has paid or secured £10,800 there
will still remain (subject to I know not what charges) £5200.
While the stocks are so very high as not to yield four per cent.,
might it not be expedient to trust it in two or three loans in
good personal bond security at four and a half? Would not
the Goslings for the consideration of the half per cent. bind
themselves to answer for the interest and principal. In their
business they have always a command of money, and if the
security be such as I ought to accept, the risk for themselves
must be very inconsiderable. *But I wish you to chuse and
execute one or the other of these arrangements with sage discretion
and absolute power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIRTY LAND AND VILE MONEY.</div>

<p>I shorten my letter, that I may dispatch it by this post.
I see the time, and I shall rejoyce to see it at the end of
twenty years, when my cares will be at an end, and our friendly
pages will be no longer sullied with the repetition of dirty land
and vile money; when we may expatiate on the politics of the
World and our personal sentiments. Without expecting your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
answer of business, I mean to write soon in a purer style,
and I wish to lay open to my friend the state of my mind,
which (exclusive of all worldly concerns) is not perfectly at
ease. In the mean while, I must add two or three short
articles. 1. I am astonished at Elmsly's silence, and the immobility
of your picture. Mine should have departed long since,
could I have found a sure opportunity.* It had almost started
last week had I not been afraid of rolling it, but I think that
a person on whom we may depend will undertake the journey
and commission about the middle of next month. 2. I shall
expect the Madeira with impatience if it is remarkable. I have
not any objection to the <em>two</em> hogsheads, but perhaps one may
suffice, as I have a promise from Sir Ralph Payne, with whom
you may confabulate on the subject if you excurse to London.
3. Give me some account of the two old Ladies. I no longer
write to Cliffe, as I suppose her (perhaps erroneously) incapable
of correspondence. I embrace My Lady, &amp;c. When shall I see
them at Lausanne or Sheffield Place? the one must take place if
the other does not. Adieu.</p>

<p class="signature">
Yours,<br />
E. G.
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;If you met with another neat, safe, little mortgage of
£2000 I have no objection. Since I have again opened my letter,
I will ask you how the property of an Ecclesiastical differs from
that of a lay Corporation, and whether you think Parliament
could legally seize and appropriate the lands of the City of
London. If either Corporation was mischievous, Government
might indeed extinguish it in time, by prohibiting a supply of
new members, and the vacant property would perhaps devolve to
the public. No change of events or opinions in France: next
month will be critical from the Provincial Assemblies.</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 15th, 1790.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEGAL FORMS BENEFIT LAWYERS.</div>

<p>*Since the first origin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab ovo</i>) of our connection and correspondence,
so long an interval of silence has not intervened, as
far as I remember, between us.* Yet on the present occasion
neither is materially to blame, nor has either been materially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
injured. My conscience was easy, since my last letter, I felt
myself in the proud security of a creditor, and though after a
certain space I waited every post for an answer, yet I waited with
little impatience and no anxiety, in the firm persuasion that Lady-day
would finally settle the whole transaction of the mortgage
and the payment. I now find that the delay is involuntary and
indefinite, and that it is not so easy to escape even from the
amicable grip of the Court of Chancery. Can such superstitious
forms be of any use except to the Lawyers? whose bill I much
apprehend. Might not such an obsolete deed which I had perfectly
forgot, have been thrown into the fire with the consent of
all parties? However we must follow the stream, and I trust
that neither Sussex nor Africa, nor Reading nor Bristol will relax
your diligence in the cause of your friend. In the winding up
an arrangement of twenty years, it is vexatious to be stopped by
a little knot: but otherwise my nerves are not so much discomposed
as you might suspect. As I believe the purchasers to be
honest and sincere, the difference is only between the rent and
the interest: the tenant deserves no mercy, and I hope your
orders are absolute for distraining the next day on failure of payment.
I trust that the £8000 mortgage is settled with Sainsbury,
nor do I dislike your last resolution of pouring the whole residue
into the funds.</p>

<p>*From my silence you conclude that the moral complaint,
which I had insinuated in my last, is either insignificant or
fanciful. The conclusion is rash. But the complaint in question
is of the nature of a slow lingering disease, which is not attended
with any immediate danger. As I have not leisure to expatiate,
take the idea in three words: "Since the loss of poor Deyverdun,
I am <em>alone</em>; and even in paradise, solitude is painful to a social
mind. When I was a dozen years younger, I <em>scarcely</em> felt the
weight of a single existence amidst the crowds of London, of
Parliament, of Clubs; but it will press more heavily upon me in
this tranquil land, in the decline of life, and with the encrease of
infirmities. Some expedient, even the most desperate, must be
embraced, to secure the domestic society of a male or female
companion. But I am not in a hurry; there is time for reflection
and advice." During this winter such finer feelings have been
suspended by the grosser evil of bodily pain. On the ninth of
February I was seized by such a fit of the Gout as I had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
known, though I must be thankful that its dire effects have been
confined to the feet and knees, without ascending to the more
noble parts. With some vicissitudes of better and worse, I have
groaned between two and three months; the debility has survived
the pain, and though now easy, I am carried about in my chair,
without any power, and with a very distant chance, of supporting
myself, from the extreme weakness and contraction of the joints
of my knees. Yet I am happy in a skilful physician, and kind
assiduous friend: every evening, during more than three months,
has been enlivened (except when I have been forced to refuse
them) by some chearful visits, and very often by a chosen party
of both sexes. How different is such society from the solitary
evenings which I have passed in the tumult of London! It is
not worth while fighting about a shadow, but should I ever
return to England, Bath, not the Metropolis, would be my last
retreat.</p>

<p>Your portrait is at last arrived in perfect condition, and now
occupies a conspicuous place over the chimney-glass in my library.
It is the object of general admiration; good judges (the few)
applaud the work; the name of Reynolds opens the eyes and
mouths of the many; and were not I afraid of making you vain,
I would inform you that the original is not allowed to be more
than five-and-thirty. In spite of private reluctance and public
discontent, I have honourably dismissed <em>myself</em>.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> I shall arrive
at Sir Joshua's before the end of the month; he will give me a
look, and perhaps a touch; and you will be indebted to the
president one guinea for the carriage. Do not be nervous, I am
not rolled up; had I been so, you might have gazed on my
charms four months ago. I want some account of yourself, of
My lady, (shall we never directly correspond?) of Louisa, and of
the soft, the stately Maria. How has the latter since her launch
supported a quiet Winter in Sussex? I so much rejoice in your
divorce from that b&mdash;&mdash; Kitty Coventry,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> that I care not what
marriage you contract. The second City in England would suit
your dignity, and the duties of a Bristol Member, which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
kill me in the first session, would supply your activity with a
constant fund of amusement. But tread softly and surely; the
ice is deceitful, the water is deep, and you may be soused over
head and ears before you are aware. Why did not you or Elmsly
send me the African pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> by the post? it would not have
cost much. You have such a knack of turning a nation, that I
am afraid you will triumph (perhaps by the force of argument)
over justice and humanity. But do you not expect to work at
Beelzebub's sugar plantations in the infernal regions, under the
tender government of a negro-driver? I should suppose both
My lady and Miss Firth very angry with you.</p>

<p>As to the bill for prints, which has been too long neglected,
why will you not exercise the power, which I have never revoked,
over all my cash at the Goslings'? I have no further claims either
for quarto or octavo copies, but I am persuaded that Cadell's
liberality will credit your applications in my name for one of
each. The Severy family has passed a very favourable winter;
the young man is impatient to hear from a family which he
places something above the Holy family: yet he will generously
write next week, and send you a drawing of the alterations in
the house. Do not raise your ideas; you know <em>I</em> am satisfied
with convenience in architecture, and some elegance in furniture.
I hear nothing decisive either from Sir Ralph Payne about
Madeira, and if I do not receive a supply in the course of the
summer, I shall be in great shame and distress. I would write
to the Bath Knight if I knew his address. That is serious
business, but I admire the coolness with which you ask me to
epistolize Reynell and Elmsly, as if a letter were so easy and
pleasant a task; it appears less so to me every day.*</p>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 28th July, '90.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD SHEFFIELD RETURNED FOR BRISTOL.</div>

<p>I wish I had better paper, but this is good enough for a
foreigner. At length I have obtained an attested copy of Hester's
Will, but no further letter or information from Mr. Law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>I find the Will was made in November, 1786, and is of
considerable length, altho' her nephew Edward Gibbon takes
up not much more than two lines of it. The rest says much
about the family of Law, and the heirs of the Rev. Wm. Law.
It gives the Sussex Estate to Edward Gibbon and his heirs for
ever, and one thousand pounds to the said Edward, and one
hundred pounds to her niece Lady Eliot, but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chat d'enfer</i>, by
a codicil dated 18th February, 1788, when her nephew resided
in Downing Street, took the trouble of reducing the thousand
pounds to one hundred pounds, to be paid within 12 months after
her decease. When there is an opportunity I shall send the composition
to you. And now you are once more a landed man.
But I wonder I have not had a summons lately to attend Messrs.
Sainsbury and Rhodes to conclude the Buriton business. I have
furnished them with every paper, &amp;c., they have desired, and I
verily believe they are proceeding, yet it seems in a truly Chancery
style. They plagued me lately about a deed for which it was
necessary to ransack the boxes.</p>

<p>My last letter was from Clifton near Bristol (I believe) after
my return from Coventry, and I also believe I therein mentioned
Proceedings at Reading, Bristol, and Coventry. I was detained
some time among my constituents for the purpose of incorporating
a due quantity of Turtle, and on leaving them I subscribed somewhat
above £300 to Infirmary, Magdalens, Small Debtors, &amp;c.
but that was all my expence at Bristol. I suppose I mentioned in
my last that my expences at Coventry did not exceed £150.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Banks<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and family have been here several days, and
inquired much after you. They are just gone, and Batt is just
arrived, and stays till Brighthelmstone Races next week. Lord
North and family are at Tunbridge Wells, and will make a visit
here as soon as we are settled after Races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HESTER GIBBON'S WILL.</div>

<p>Perhaps it may be needful to mention to you that the rent of
your Newhaven, alias Meeching Farm, is £225. The Manor is
considerable, the quit-rents and profits above £40&mdash;the latter
uncertain. The deductions on account of Land-tax and Sackville
College rent and expenses of collecting quit-rent about £29. I
shall not readily approve of your selling it, but if you should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
desperately disposed to increase your income, what do you think
of taking double or treble the clear rent for your life, for the
said Estate? I suppose about £550 per annum, which allows for
outgoings, including repairs of sea-walls and every deduction but
moderately&mdash;they have been of late years somewhat immoderate.</p>

<p>If you do not think of making little ones, it may suit you and
it would me, although I am poor, because it would be a very
respectable addition to my Sussex Estate. It would give me
marshland of which I have none, also the mouth of the River
Ouse, &amp;c.: and perhaps a small house on the sea-shore. I do not
know that it would be a good bargain for you and your heirs, but
I think it would be a good one for the House of Holroyd, except
that I should not like to be benefitted by the Devil taking you&mdash;yet
I do not suspect I should wish it. In case of his taking me
or not, you would have a collateral security besides that of the
Estate itself. The best argument for your doing it is that I shall
with-hold my consent to your selling it. On this subject you will
give your mind without ceremony. It will furnish you with
subject matter for a letter.</p>

<p class="signature">
Yours ever,<br />
S.
</p>

<p>Remember us to the house of Severy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>553.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, August 7, 1790.
</p>

<p>*I answer at once your two letters; and I should probably
have taken earlier notice of the first, had I not been in daily
expectation of the second. I must begin on the subject of what
really interests me the most, your glorious election for Bristol.
Most sincerely do I congratulate your exchange of a cursed
expensive jilt, who deserted you for a rich Jew, for an honourable
connection with a chaste and virtuous matron, who will probably
be as constant as she is disinterested. In the whole range of
election from Caithness to St. Yves, I much doubt whether there
be a single choice so truly honourable to the member and the
constituents. The second Commercial city invites, from a distant
province, an independent Gentleman, known only by his active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
spirit, and his writings on the subject of trade; and names him,
without intrigue or expence, for her representative: even the voice
of party is silenced, While factions strive which shall applaud the
most.</p>

<p>You are now sure, for seven years to come, of never wanting
food&mdash;I mean business; what a crowd of suitors or Complainants
will besiege your door! what a load of letters and memorials will
be heaped on your table! I much question whether even you
will not sometimes exclaim, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ohe! jam satis est!</i> but that is your
affair. Of the excursion to Coventry I cannot decide, but I hear
it is pretty generally blamed: but, however, I love gratitude to
an old friend; and shall not be very angry if you damned them
with a farewell to all eternity. But I cannot repress my indignation
at the use of those foolish, obsolete, odious words, Whig and
Tory. In the American War they might have some meaning;
and then your Lordship was a Tory: since the coalition, all
general principles have been confounded; and if there ever was
an opposition to men, not measures, it is the present. Luckily,
both the Leaders are great men; and, whatever happens, the
country must fall upon its legs. What a strange mist of peace
and war seems to hang over the ocean! We can perceive nothing
but secrecy and vigour; but those are excellent qualities to perceive
in a Minister. From yourself and politics I now return to
my private concerns, which I shall methodically consider under
the three great articles of mind, body, and estate.* And first, as
Aristotle says, of the first.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMFORTLESS STATE OF DOMESTIC SOLITUDE.</div>

<p>*1. I am not absolutely displeased at your firing so hastily at
the hint, a tremendous hint, in my last letter. But the danger is
not so serious or imminent as you seem to suspect; and I give
you my word, that, before I take the slightest step which can
bind me either in law, conscience, or honour, I will faithfully
communicate, and we will freely discuss, the whole state of the
business. But at present there is not any thing to communicate
or discuss; I do assure you that I have not any particular object
in view: I am not in love with any of the Hyænas of Lausanne,
though there are some who keep their claws tolerably well pared.
Sometimes, in a solitary mood, I have fancied myself married to
one or other of those whose society and conversation are the
most pleasing to me; but when I have painted in my fancy all
the probable consequences of such an union, I have started from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
my dream, rejoyced in my escape, and ejaculated a thanksgiving
that I was still in possession of my natural freedom. Yet I feel,
and shall continue to feel, that domestic solitude, however it may
be alleviated by the world, by study, and even by friendship, is a
comfortless state, which will grow more painful as I descend in
the vale of years. At present my situation is very tolerable; and
if at dinner-time, or at my return home in the evening, I sometimes
sigh for a companion, there are many hours, and many
occasions, in which I enjoy the superior blessing of being sole
master of my own house. But your plan, though less dangerous,
is still more absurd than mine: such a couple as you describe
could not be found; and, if found, would not answer my purpose;
their rank and position would be awkward and ambiguous
to myself and my acquaintance; and the agreement of
three persons of three characters would be still more impracticable.
My plan of Charlotte Porten is undoubtedly the most desirable;
and she might either remain a spinster (the case is not without
example,) or marry some Swiss of my choice, who would increase
and enliven our society; and both would have the strongest
motives for kind and dutiful behaviour. But the mother has
been indirectly sounded; and will not hear of such a proposal for
some years. On my side, I would not take her, but as a piece of
soft wax which I could model to the language and manners of
the Country: I must therefore be patient.</p>

<p>2. Young Severy's letter, which may be now in your hands,
and which, for these three or four last posts, has furnished my
indolence with a new pretence for delay, has already informed
you of the means and circumstances of my resurrection. Tedious
indeed was my confinement, since I was not able to move from
my house or chair, from the ninth of February to the first of
July, very nearly five months. The first weeks were accompanied
with more pain than I have ever known in the Gout, with
anxious days and sleepless nights; and when that pain subsided,
it left a weakness in my knees, which seemed to have no end.
My confinement was however softened by books, by the possession
of every comfort and convenience, by a succession each evening
of agreeable company, and by a flow of equal spirits and
general good health. During the last weeks I descended to the
ground floor, poor Deyverdun's apartment, and constructed a
chair like Merlin's, in which I could wheel myself in the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and on the terrace. My patience has been universally admired;
yet how many thousands have passed those five months less easily
than myself. I remember making a remark perfectly simple, and
perfectly true: "At present," I said to Madame de Severy, "I
am not positively miserable, and I may reasonably hope a daily or
weekly improvement, till sooner or later in the summer I shall
recover new limbs, and new pleasures, which I do not now possess:
have any of you such a prospect?" The prediction has been
accomplished, and I have arrived to my present condition of
strength, or rather of feebleness: I now can walk with tolerable
ease in my garden and smooth places; but on the rough pavement
of the town I use, and perhaps shall use, a sedan chair.
The Pyrmont waters have performed wonders; and my physician
(not Tissot, but a very sensible man) allows me to hope, that the
term of the interval will be in proportion to that of the fit.*</p>

<p>3. And so Aunt Hester is gone to sing Hallelujahs, a glory
which she did not seem very impatient to possess. I received the
news of this dire event with much philosophic composure: she
might have done better, she might have done worse, and I was
always prepared for the worst. By this time you have probably
a copy of the Will, and will take (as I suppose you are authorized)
the proper and necessary steps. I most wish to learn whether she
has left me the fee simple, the absolute disposal of her Sussex
estate; the power of selling or the necessity of keeping that
costly piece of property will make a wonderful difference in the
value of her gift. From a motive of curiosity I wish to learn
what she has done with her personal fortune; her four copper
shares were worth at least five or six thousand pounds. Has she
given them to the Laws? If in the bequeathing what was
absolutely in her power she has postponed relations for friends,
I think her determination both honourable and wise. If in the
entailed estate she has preferred a poor though unbelieving
nephew to a rich niece, she was likewise right. I speak with the
impartiality of a third person.</p>

<p>And now let me seriously address you on the most important
of my temporal concerns, Buriton. You will do me the justice
to allow that I have not been either impatient or nervous:
but the Estate was sold in April, 1789: this is now August,
1790, and the money is not yet paid, nor the purchase concluded.
Is Lord Stawell perfidious, is he poor, is he unwilling? is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
delay only produced by the ingenious forms of the lawyers?
How many terms do they require for an amicable suit in Chancery?
In the meanwhile I lose interest, the estate must suffer
by neglect, and what will be the event? Exert your vigour,
argue, persuade, consummate! On the 10th of November next
my father will have been dead twenty years: let it not be
said that with the counsel and aid of such a friend, I have not
been able to settle my affairs in twenty years. What can I
say more? the conclusion an Indian Epistle.</p>

<p>Yes, I have more or rather nothing more to say about the disposal
of the money. I hope the Buriton mortgage for £8000 still
holds: nothing else can be so easy or good. The remainder you
will throw into the funds, and I wish we could take advantage of
the present fall, but if a sure bond or neat mortgage from £2500
to £4000 should offer itself, I should be very well pleased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SWISS SENSIBLE OF THEIR HAPPINESS.</div>

<p>*Have you read in the English papers, that the Government of
Bern is overturned, and that we are divided into three Democratical
leagues; true as the Gospel: true as what I have read in
the French papers, that the English have cut off Pitt's head, and
abolished the house of Lords. The people of this country are
happy; and in spite of some malcontents, and more foreign
Emissaries, they are sensible of their happiness.*</p>

<p>My <span class="smcap">Madeira</span> is almost exhausted, and I must receive before
the end of the Autumn a stout cargo of wholesome exquisite wine
with proper <em>previous</em> notice which may prevent all accidents at the
Custom House. Your Bristol connection must give you great
advantages, but (if I could procure his direction) I would not
neglect Sir Ralph Payne's favours.</p>

<p>*Inform My lady, that I am indignant at a false and heretical
assertion in her last letter to Severy, "that friends at a distance
cannot love each other, if they do not write." I love her better
than any woman in the world; indeed I do; and yet I do not
write. And she herself&mdash;but I am calm. We have now nearly
one hundred French exiles, some of them worth being acquainted
with; particularly a Count de Schomberg, who is become almost
my friend; he is a man of the World, of letters, and of sufficient
age, since in 1753 he succeeded to Marshal Saxe's regiment of
Dragoons. As to the rest, I entertain them, and they flatter
me: but I wish we were reduced to our Lausanne society. Poor
France! the state is dissolved, the nation is mad! Adieu.*</p>

<h2>554.</h2>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 21st Sept., '90.
</p>

<p>I approve your observations on the Bristol Election, and I do
not believe you heard the Excursion to Coventry pretty generally
blamed. I knew nothing of an Opposition till two days after the
Poll began. A man who had been useful to me in the same line
being concerned, I had no difficulty nor hesitation as to what was
to be done.</p>

<p>On the subject of Buriton I acknowledge you have been as
Philosophic as could be expected. There seems to be something
supernatural attending all your worldly concerns. In answer to
a repeated remonstrance to Mr. Sainsbury, the last information is
from Mr. Rhodes the Attorney, dated Sept. 4th instant. He
says (Mrs. Sainsbury desired him to write, Mr. Sainsbury being
in Ireland), "The matter in Chancery remains unfinished by the
Master. When we obtained the Deed and laid it before him, he
said that he had then so many other reports to prepare that he
was apprehensive that he should not be able to prepare ours.
We said and did everything in our power to induce him to do it,
but we could not prevail. He has promised to let us have it
before the ensuing Term, which will begin on the 6th of November
next, and the other business cannot be completed before the first
week in the term." It is difficult to believe these delays are
intentional, as a considerable sum remains dormant as to the
Land in the hands of the Auctioneers, Messrs. Skinners, and
as so great a proportion of the purchase money is to remain
in Mortgage. The only thing I can firmly object to, is an
over nicety on the part of Sainsbury or his Lawyers as to the
title, but I shall go to London as soon as Term begins and
reiterate every measure that can speedily bring matters to a
conclusion. In the meantime I shall be very troublesome until
I am assured every paper is ready for signature. As to the Estate
it does not suffer by neglect; a new Tenant recommended by
Sainsbury has taken it from the poor flimsy creature that held
it in a fright, and Andrewes stoutly exacts the rent when due.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD SHEFFIELD'S OFFER FOR NEWHAVEN.</div>

<p>We almost howled when we read the tremendous account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
nearly five months' confinement&mdash;the weakness in your traces
affrighted me most, but I rejoiced exceedingly in your last, which
says that you have advanced to nearly your usual condition of
strength. I never heard of Pyrmont waters for the gout&mdash;but
I grieve to tell you that notwithstanding repeated applications I
find your Hogshead of Madeira (which is on its travels) may not
arrive sooner than 4, 5, or 6 months. I must spare you all I can
of my Old Madeira which is in London, but I do not know that
it will amount to a quantity worth the trouble of sending. I
shall make every effort and inquire everywhere for you. As to
Sir Ralph Payne, surely a letter directed to him in London would
find him, if you think that mode preferable.</p>

<p>Your plan as to Charlotte Porten might be the most desirable,
but nothing could be more fancifull than to suppose it could
possibly succeed, unless you could send a Demon cracked from
Paris to hang the mother to a Lanthern.</p>

<p>My last letter answers your question whether Hester had left
you the fee-simple of the Sussex Estate. I have learned nothing
more concerning that Holy woman since the receipt of the Copy
of her Will, nor am I likely, unless I should find some of the
family of the Laws in London next winter. I think you should
inclose to me an order to the Executors, Messrs. William Law,
Senior, of Kings Cliffe, and William Law of Stamford, to deliver
to me all the Writings, Papers, Surveys, Plans, &amp;c., relating to
the Sussex Estate, and you may add, those which relate to the
Family of Gibbon.</p>

<p>When Batt was here not long since, I mentioned to him your
old Aunt's Bequest and my proposition to you; at first, he did
not object, but next day he scouted my folly and extravagance
in diminishing my Income. My observations that I should and
could easily cut down annually more timber than would pay the
difference, and that in case I went to glory, those who came after
me would be fully compensated in the end for loss of Income&mdash;I
say, these observations seemed to make little impression on him.
However, I was somewhat chilled, yet I cannot help thinking it
or something of the kind might answer to both of us, if you
should be desperately disposed to sell to increase your Income.
I should acquire a position on the Sea-Shore&mdash;but you may have
thought of something that would answer your purpose better.</p>

<p>You admire the Minister's secrecy and vigour. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
secrecy in the case, but surely he has made a desperate plunge, and
it appears to me a very wanton one&mdash;and if it is right to take an
advantage, he is losing the opportunity.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> It is difficult to suppose
that Spain will engage <em>single-handed</em> with us, but we may bully
them into it, and although France cannot at present do much, yet
the adherence of the National Assembly to the Family compact
may help the Spaniards to be stout, and above all it would be
good policy in the French Aristocrats to dash France into a
war at all events.</p>

<p>You are incorrigible, but we desire that you will encourage
De Severy to write. It is surprising he can write and remember
English so well. The alterations in your Chateau pleased us very
much. I have enquired more than once whether you would have

<p class="head">
À Rolle, ce 12 Octobre, 1790.
</p>

<p>Je vous aurois plutot remercié, Monsieur, des soins obligeans
que vous avez bien voulû vous donner pour me procurer les
Origines Guelficæ,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> si d'un côté notre honnête libraire Mr. Pott
ne m'avoit pas appris que vous etiez en voyage, si de l'autre je
n'avois pas été moi même en proye à l'acces de goutte le plus
rigoureux et le plus long que j'aye encore éprouvé.</p>

<p>Nous revoici à present dans notre état ordinaire, je marche, et
vous ne courez plus. Je vous suppose bien etabli, bien enfoncé
dans votre immense bibliotheque dans un endroit qui fournit
peut-être un choix plus étendu et plus interessant des morts que
des vivans. Comme vous êtes également propre à vivre avec les
uns et les autres, je desirerois pour votre bonheur aussi bien que
pour celui de vos amis, que vous pûssiez enfin executer comme
moi le projet de chercher une douce retraite sur les bords du lac
Leman. Il s'en faut de beaucoup que vous n'y soyez oublié:
nous parlons souvent de vous surtout dans la famille de Severy,
nous regrettons votre absence et en nous rappellant l'aimable
franchise, la vivacité piquante de <em>l'Esclave</em>, nous cherisons
l'esperance de vous revoir parmi nous en homme libre, ne dependant
que de vos gouts et pouvant vous donner tout entier aux
lettres et à la societé.</p>

<p>Vous aurez sans doute appris la perte irreparable que j'ai faite
du pauvre Deyverdun. En vertu de son testament et de mes
arrangemens avec son heritier Mr. le Major de Montagny, je me
suis assuré ma vie durant la jouissance de sa maison et de son
jardin. Vous en connoissez tous les agrémens qui se sont encore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
augmentés par une dépense assez considerable et assez bien
tendu que j'y ai faité depuis sa mort. Je dois être content de
ma position mais on ne peut pas remplacer un ami de trente ans.
Votre curiosité, peut-être votre amitié, desirera de connoitre mes
amusemens, mes travaux, mes projets pendant les deux ans qui se
sont écoulé depuis la dernière publication de mon grand ouvrage.
Aux questions indiscretes qu'on se permet trop souvent vis-à-vis
de moi, je responds avec une mine renfrognée et d'une manière
vague, mais je ne veux rien avoir de caché pour vous et pour
imiter la franchise que vous aimez, je vous avouerai naturellement
que ma confidence est fondée en partie sur le besoin que
j'aurai de votre secours.</p>

<p>Après mon retour d'Angleterre les premiers mois ont été
consacrés à la jouissance de ma liberté et de ma bibliotheque,
et vous ne serez pas étonné si j'ai renouvellé une connoissance
familière avec vos auteurs Grecs et si j'ai fait v&oelig;u de leur
reserver tous les jours une portion de mon loisir. Je passe
sous silence ces tristes momens dans lesquels je n'ai été occupé
qu'à soigner et à pleurer mon ami: mais dès que j'ai commencé
à me retrouver un esprit moins agile, j'ai cherché à me
donner quelque distraction plus forte et plus interessante que
la simple lecture. Le souvenir de ma servitude de vingt ans
m'a cependant effrayé et je me suis bien promis de ne plus
m'embarquer dans une entreprise de longue haleine que je
n'acheverois vraisemblablement jamais. Il vaut bien mieux, me
suis je dit, choisir, dans tous les pays et dans tous les siecles, des
morceaux historiques que je traiterai separément suivant leur
nature et selon mon gout. Lorsque ces opuscules (je pourrai les
nommer en Anglais, <cite>Historical Excursions</cite>) me fourniront un
volume, je le donnerai au public: ce don pourroit etre renouvellé
jusqu'a ce que nous soyons fatigués ou ce public ou moi même:
mais chaque volume, complet par lui même, n'exigera point de
suite, et au lieu d'être borné comme la diligence au grand chemin,
je me promenerai librement dans le champ de l'histoire en
m'arrêtant partout où je trouve des points de vue agreables.
Dans ce projet je ne vois qu'un inconvenient,&mdash;un objet interessant
s'étend et s'aggrandit sous le travail: je pourrois être entrainé au
dela de mes bornes, mais je serai doucement entrainé sans prevoyance
et sans contrainte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HISTORY OF THE GUELFS.</div>

<p>Mes soupçons ont été vérifiés dans le choix de ma première<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<em>excursion</em>. Ce que j'avois si bien prevu n'a pas manqué d'arriver
à mon premier choix et ce choix vous expliquera pourquoi j'ai
demandé avec tant d'empressement les Origines Guelficæ. Dans
mon histoire j'avois rendu compte de deux alliances illustres, d'un
fils du Marquis Azo d'Este avec une fille de Robert Guiscard,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> d'une
princesse de Brunswick avec l'Empereur Grec. Un premier
appercu de l'antiquité et de la grandeur de la maison de Brunswick
a excité ma curiosité, et j'ai cru me pouvoir interesser les
deux nations que j'estime le plus par les mémoires d'une famille
qui est sortie de l'une pour regner sur l'autre. Mes recherches,
en me devoilant la beauté de ce sujet, m'en ont fait voir l'étendue
et la difficulté. L'origine des Marquis de Ligurie et peut-être de
Toscane a été suffisament eclaircie par Muratori et Leibnitz;
l'Italie du moyen age, son histoire et ses monumens, me sont très
connus et je ne suis pas mécontent de ce que j'ai déjà écrit
sur la branche cadette d'Este qui est demeurée fidelle a garder ses
cendres casanières. Les anciens Guelfs ne me sont point étrangers,
et je me crois en etat de rendre compte de la puissance et de
la chute de leurs heritiers, les Ducs de Bavière et de Saxe.</p>

<p>La succession de la maison de Brunswick au trône de la Grande
Bretagne sera très assurément la partie la plus interessante de
mon travail; mais tous les materiaux se trouvent dans ma
langue, et un Anglois devroit rougir s'il n'avoit pas approfondi
l'histoire moderne et la constitution actuelle de son pays. Mais
entre le premier Duc et le premier Electeur de Brunswick il se
trouve un intervalle de quatre cent cinquante ans, je suis condamné
à suivre dans les tenèbres un sentier étroit et raboteux, et
les divisions, les sous divisions, de tant de branches et de territoires
repandent sur ce sentier la confusion d'un labyrinthe
Genealogique. Les événemens sans éclat et sans liaison sont
bornés à une province d'Allemagne et ce n'est que vers la fin de
cette periode que je serois un peu ranimé par la reformation, la guerre
de trente ans, et la nouvelle puissance de l'Electorat. Comme je
me propose de crayonner des Memoires et non pas de composer
une histoire, je marcherois sans doute d'un pas rapide, je presenterois
des resultats plutot que des faits, des observations plutot
que des récits: mais vous sentez, combien un tableau general
exige de connoissances particulières, combien l'auteur doit être
plus savant que son livre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Or cet auteur, il est à deux cent lieues de la Saxe, il ignore
la langue et il ne s'est jamais appliqué à l'histoire de l'Allemagne.
Eloigné des sources, il ne lui reste qu'un seul moyen pour les
faire couler dans sa bibliotheque. C'est de se menager sur les
lieux même un correspondant exact, un guide eclairé, un oracle
enfin qu'il puisse consulter dans tous ses besoins. Par votre
caractère, votre esprit, vos lumières, votre position, vous êtes
cet homme precieux et unique que je cherche, et quand vous
m'indiquerez un <em>suppléant</em> aussi capable que vous même je ne
m'addresserois pas avec la même confiance à un étranger. Je vous
accablerois librement de questions, et de nouvelles questions naitroient
souvent de vos reponses; je vous prierois de fouiller dans
votre vaste depôt; je vous demanderois des notices, des livres, des
extraits, des traductions, des renseignements sur tous les objets
qui peuvent intéresser mon travail. Mais j'ignore si vous êtes
disposé à sacrifier votre loisir, vos études chéries à une correspondance
pénible sans agrémens et sans gloire. Je me flatte que
vous feriez quelque chose pour moi, vous feriez encore davantage
pour l'honneur de la maison à laquelle vous êtes attaché, mais
suis-je en droit de supposer que mes ecrits puissent contribuer
de quelque chose à son honneur?</p>

<p>J'attends, Monsieur, votre reponse qu'elle soit prompte et
franche. Si vous daignez vous associer à mon entreprise, je vous
envoyerai sur le champ mon premier interrogatoire. Votre refus
me decideroit à renoncer à mon dessein, ou du moins à lui donner
une nouvelle forme. J'ose en même tems vous demander un
profond secret: un mot indiscret seroit repeté par cent bouches
et j'aurois le desagrement de voir dans les journaux, et bientôt
dans les papiers Anglois, une annonce, peut-être défigurée, de mes
projets littéraires, qui ne sont confiés qu'à vous seul.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">SERVITUDE TO LAWYERS.</div>

<p>You call me incorrigible: but I never was less disposed than
at present to plead guilty. Have you forgot the general picture
of mind, body and estate which I sent you since my recovery? in
the tranquil life of Lausanne a long interval might elapse without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
affording any features to alter or any colours to vary. On the
most interesting topic, poor Buriton, it is mine to hear rather
than to write, and most ardently indeed do I now desire to hear
of the conclusion of that incomprehensible business. Is it possible,
are we under such servitude to the lawyers that an obsolete act
without force or meaning should have hung us up for a year in
Chancery? If I do not learn before the end of the year that
the money is paid and placed, I shall be as miserable as pecuniary
events can make me; when it is done I am easy and happy for
life. In the midst of your arduous affairs I do not suspect any
failure of zeal, but I now call upon you to redouble your speed,
and to strain every nerve till we have reached the goal. Till
the present business I never imagined that it was difficult to find
people who would take your money. It is lucky that Sainsbury
has consented to leave £8000 on Buriton: with regard to the
remainder I leave it absolutely to your judgement, but since you
distrust with reason private bond security, I see no other way
than throwing it into the funds; a short delay might be allowed
in expectation of their sinking, but the rise and fall are so uncertain,
that it might be the 'rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis.'
In the mean while Buriton rent must be paid, and as the two
quarters due at Lady day had been neglected, the whole year till
last Michaelmas must be rigorously exacted. I do not believe
(though I would not give a gentleman the lye) that you ever
asked me the question about Mrs. G.'s jointure: it will be an
handsome, an easy compliment to give her a right to the three
hundred which I pay her in fact.</p>

<p>Let us now make a tour to Newhaven. Upon the whole I
am very well satisfied. You remark that about February, 1788,
the old Saint decimated her nephew: but have you forgot that
her atheistical nephew had neglected to accept her invitation and
would not even write her a civil letter? surely <em>he</em> has no right to
complain. I am ignorant of the character and behaviour of the
Laws, but in the general principle of preferring friends to relations,
I think her perfectly right.&mdash;You were not surely impatient
for an answer to your proposal: it demands the coolest deliberation,
and there cannot be the smallest occasion for dispatch. I
will however impart such ideas as have arisen.</p>

<p>1. I agree with Batt in thinking it an unwise measure for
yourself. Is this a time to diminish your income when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
must enlarge or at least support your expence, when you know
that for seven years to come you will not enjoy the benefit of
a single winter fallow? If you have timber it will be sufficiently
wanted for your annual supplies.</p>

<p>2. The balance of my fortune and my wishes depends on a
contingency which I have neither power nor inclination to hasten.
As soon as the Belvidere subsides, I am rich beyond all my plans
of expence at Lausanne. Every winter such an event is probable,
and it is highly probable that it will happen in three or four
winters. It is indeed possible that a fine thread may be drawn
to a great length without breaking, and if I turned a landed
estate into an annuity, I should never be at a loss to employ the
superfluity. If my heir, the creature of my choice does not think
he has enough, the dog has too much.</p>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 3rd Jan., 1791.
</p>

<p>It occurs to me in the midst of much hurry, that you may
have a wish for further information on the subject of the Madeira.
It was shipped for Ostend on the 3rd Dec., with full and ample
instructions (according to your own directions) for its conveyance
to Basle, where it is to wait your further orders. I suppose
that on the receipt of my former letter you wrote to your correspondent
there.</p>

<p>The Wine is gone in one hogshead and one tierce, marked
&amp; No. E. G. No. 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>The Bill as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>Probably it is the best wine of the kind that ever reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
centre of Europe. You will remember that an Hogshead is on
his travels through the torrid zone for you. I suppose you do
not mean to decline it when it arrives. No wine is meliorated to
a greater degree by keeping than Madeira, and you latterly
appeared so ravenous for it, that I must conceive you wish to
have a stock.</p>

<p>I have had a Congress with Sainsbury, &amp;c. The business
has been referred to the Master of the Rolls. I have talked
with the Master. It seems in good train. The conveyance
is preparing. The message of young Porten is very troublesome.
Sainsbury wished to avoid taking the £8000 on mortgage.
I remonstrated strongly. He agreed, handsomely, to take it
rather than embarrass. I have promised £4000 on a Yorkshire
mortgage. I have been very busy in Town. I am glad I cannot
finish <em>the Paper</em>, because you are such a worthless fellow, that you
do not answer even on business.</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
1791.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIBBON'S SERIOUS ILLNESS.</div>

<p>*Your indignation will melt into pity, when you hear that for
several weeks past I have been again confined to my chamber and
my chair. Yet I must hasten, generously hasten, to exculpate the
Gout, my old enemy, from the curses which you already pour on
his head. He is not the cause of this disorder, although the consequences
have been somewhat similar.* After some days of fever
and a most violent oppression in my head and stomach, the
morbid humour forced itself into my right leg, which was covered
from my knee to my toe with a strong inflammatory <em>Erisipèle</em> or
Rash. I was gradually relieved by a plentiful discharge of pus
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atque Venenum</i> (excuse the indelicacy) which, according to my
Physician, has surpassed that of fifty blisters. The skin has been
compleatly renewed, and I now crawl about the house upon two
sticks. *I am satisfied that this effort of nature has saved me
from a very dangerous, perhaps a fatal, crisis; and I listen to the
flattering hope that it may tend to keep the Gout at a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
respectful distance.* You will determine whether it ought to
raise or sink the purchase of my annuity.</p>

<p>I must confess that I am disappointed, vexed, harrassed,
fatigued with the strange procrastination of the Buriton affairs
which are now verging to the end of the second year. In
former transactions while we were fighting with knaves and
madmen nothing could surprise, but in this amicable connection
with a willing and able purchaser, it is indeed provoking that
term after term we should be hung up (a most proper expression)
in the forms of the Court of Chancery. You are now on the
spot, and I conjure you by every tye of friendship and humanity
to steal some moments from the service of Bristol, to strain every
nerve of your active genius, and to send me a speedy and satisfactory
account that the business is terminated, and the money
paid. The funds are indeed so very high, that I agree with you
in preferring a clear four per cent. which <em>they</em> do not yield, on
the solid basis of the Earth, I mean on good landed security. I
therefore much approve of your holding Sainsbury to his engagement
of retaining the £8000 on the mortgage of Buriton's own
self, and hope you will not fail of success in registering £4000
more in Yorkshire. Should any loose hundreds remain, they may
be best added to my India bonds in Gosling's hands. I much
fear that another half year from Buriton will become due (at
Lady-day), and hope you will order Andrews to exact it without
mercy or delay.</p>

<p>I feel myself much embarrassed how to define or establish my
claims on Hugonin. We always treated with the confidence of
friends, and the ease of Gentlemen, and his short accounts, from
art or accident, were always so vague, that I could never discern
to what half year his remittances applied. I am satisfied that
two years or at least eighteen months have never been accounted
for; but on the most moderate footing I may demand the
year's rent which ended at Michaelmas 1788, and which was
not paid when I left England. The agency of Hugonin will
not be disputed, the Tenant's receipt will prove that it was
paid into his hands, and even the silence of Gosling's books
will afford some evidence that it never was remitted for my
use. Besides, will not the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">onus probandi</i> rest on Hugonin's
heirs, who ought to produce my discharge? On recollection I
may even state my damages at eighteen months, since according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to a vile abuse, the tenant only paid at Michaelmas the year's rent
which had been due the previous Lady-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACCEPTS ANNUITY FOR NEWHAVEN.</div>

<p>I now proceed to the important business of Newhaven, and
am not sorry that we have both of us taken sufficient time to
avoid the reproach of rash and precipitate measures. As you are
not an infant I will decline any farther remonstrance of what
may be proper or improper for yourself, and will think solely of
my own interest. After mature consideration I am <em>resolved</em> to
amplify my income by the sale of Newhaven, leaving one half of
the purchase money to sink in an Annuity and the other half to
swim in a Mortgage. My old scruples against pecuniary transactions
with a friend are much diminished by my experience of
the delays and difficulties which occur in a treaty with a stranger,
and I flatter myself that you will not think it necessary to
ascertain my title to the Estate by an amicable suit in Chancery.
Your statement is impartial and your terms are liberal: Twenty-eight
years' purchase appears a fair price for an Estate circumstanced
like mine, and I am not ambitious of paying more than
twelve years for the chance of my earthly existence. But I do
not perfectly acquiesce in your striking off the casual profits to
balance the casual losses and repairs, and I must request that you
would try a very simple calculation: Supposing the three per
Cents at eighty, your landed estate, after deducting every possible
outgoing, would pay you as good interest as your money in the funds.
Is such an equality reasonable? Should you pay nothing for the
solid security of land? Is the National Debt less exposed than the
Sussex acres to be swallowed in the Ocean? The calculation is easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<p>Suppose we reduce this sum to £7000 and divide it equally, the
produce will be £430 (£140 for the Mortgage, £290 for the
Annuity). I cannot think my expectations quite unreasonable,
but I leave the final arbitration to yourself, as if we were treating
with a third person, and I authorize you to conclude with Lord
Sheffield on such conditions as I ought to ask and he will be
disposed to give. The farm itself will never answer for the
Mortgage, and you will obtain a good and sufficient security for
the annuity. In the meanwhile I should be glad to know when
I may expect the payment of some rent, and from what date it
will begin to accrue to me.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Your own offer is £4200, the Mortgage; £280 Annuity.
But arithmetic is erroneous: 3052 divided by 12 do not produce
280 but only 254. You are a pretty man of business. So much
for Newhaven.</p>

<p>Since we are talking of Wills, I must request that you
would commit mine to the flames. By the first opportunity I
will send you the duplicate of another which I have constructed
on more rational principles. You will not disapprove the preference
which I now give to the children of Sir Stanier Porten:
they are the nearest, the most indigent and the most deserving
of my relations.</p>

<p>*The whole sheet has been filled with dry selfish business; but
I must and will reserve some lines of the cover for a little friendly
conversation. I passed four days at the castle of Copet with
Necker; and could have wished to have shown him, as a warning
to any aspiring youth possessed with the Dæmon of ambition.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
With all the means of private happiness in his power, he is the
most miserable of human beings: the past, the present, and the
future are equally odious to him. When I suggested some
domestic amusements of books, building, &amp;c. he answered, with a
deep tone of despair, "Dans l'état où je suis, je ne puis sentir que
le coup de vent qui m'a abbattu." How different from the careless
chearfulness with which our poor friend Lord North supported
his fall! Madame Necker maintains more external
composure, <em>mais le Diable n'y perd rien</em>. It is true that Necker
wished to be carried into the Closet, like old Pitt, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
shoulders of the people; and that he has been ruined by the
Democracy which he had raised. I believe him to be an able
financier, and know him to be an honest man; too honest,
perhaps, for a minister. His rival Calonne has passed through
Lausanne, in his way from Turin; and was soon followed by the
Prince of Condé, with his son and grandson;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> but I was too
much indisposed to see them. They have, or have had, some
wild projects of a counter-revolution: horses have been bought,
men levied, and the Canton of Berne has too much countenanced
such foolish attempts which must end in the ruin of the party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRAISE OF BURKE'S <cite>REFLECTIONS</cite>.</div>

<p>Burke's book<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> is a most admirable medicine against the French
disease, which has made too much progress even in this happy
country. I admire his eloquence, I approve his politics, I adore
his chivalry, and I can forgive even his superstition. The primitive
Church, which I have treated with some freedom, was itself
at that time an innovation, and I was attached to the old Pagan
establishment. The French spread so many lyes about the
sentiments of the English nation, that I wish the most considerable
men of all parties and descriptions would join in some
public act, declaring themselves satisfied with and resolved to
support our present constitution. Such a declaration would have
a wonderful effect in Europe; and, were I thought worthy, I
myself should be proud to subscribe it. I have a great mind to
send you something of a sketch, such as all thinking men might
adopt.</p>

<p>I have intelligence of the approach of my Madeira, and on its
receipt will despatch a draught for the payment. I accept with
equal pleasure the second, now in the torrid zone. Send me some
pleasant details of your domestic state, of Maria, &amp;c. If my
lady thinks that my silence is a mark of indifference, my lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
is a goose. I <em>must</em> have you all at Lausanne next summer.*
Apropos, I must have £3000 on Annuity and £3000 on Mortgage:
the surplus you may divide as you like best. I wish you would
not enclose your letters to Paris. I have no longer any connections
with Lessert, and they desire not to be troubled with
them.</p>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Downing Street, 5th Feb., 1791.
</p>

<p>We remained in the country to the last moment, &amp; I came to
Town furious against you on account of your neglect of writing,
but on reaching Lord Guilford,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> I learned that you had been
very ill, &amp; I was completely softened and no longer abusive.
His information came from Major Frank North, who added that
you were recovering.</p>

<p>Now are you not a damned good-for-nothing fellow for not
recollecting that we might hear you were ill, &amp; therefore not
desiring De Severy to write a line to mention that you were
recovering? I have for a long time exhorted my Lady to write to
him. I think she will now favour him with a Philipick. What
has been the matter? for my account does not say whether it has
been the gout only or something more. I shall be really sulky if
you do not write one line. We are much annoyed. I went to
Elmsley &amp; he knew nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CORN LAWS AND SLAVE TRADE.</div>

<p>I will not write to you on business until a fragment arrives
from you, except to say the Business has stopped in hopes of
information from you relative to the amount of Hugonin's debt to
you. You know I had nothing to do with the affairs between
you and him, and of course could not make out the ballance.
Andrews has stated it to me at £347 2<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> I supposed it to
be more, therefore waited to hear from you; but I have an
Affidavit ready prepared to make before a Master for that amount;
that operation is necessary before any further progress can be
made. In addition to my other occupations I am more busied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
than ever I was in my life about a Corn Bill<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> now depending,
(as great a business as I have ever undertaken). I examined
it well during the Recess, and made ample notes on my arrival;
I have shewn them to Batt and Sir Joseph, and they recommend
strenuously that I should publish them with my name. They say
it is too argumentative, it requires too much consideration, for a
speech. They think it will do me great credit. They add it is
impossible even for a very able man in the art of speaking and in
the habit, to do it justice in a speech. In short, I am obliged to
undertake publication in such an hurry as will not produce your
commendation. The question comes on in a week. I find the
first Edition of my <cite>Observations on the Project for Abolishing the
Slave Trade</cite><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> was not sent to you. I have delivered the second
Edition to Elmsley to be forwarded when there is an opportunity.
I learned from him that you had not received Burke's <em>Pamphlet</em>.</p>

<p>If you had not been ill I should have talked to you as you deserve
about the addition to your History. It is as it should be, that I
am to hear of that addition for the first time from Newspapers or
accidental correspondents. I did not believe the circumstance
until everybody was convinced of it, and Mr. Cadell's information
was general. It is intolerable.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>560.</h2>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Downing Street, 15th March, 1791.
</p>

<p>Your manuscript at last received exhilarated us very considerably.
We heard you were better, but did not exactly know the
state of things. We had almost made up our minds to go to see
you in a snug party for a month or two in the summer, but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
you are well we do not care so much about you. Maria says the
allowance of a year's purchase is a fair offer, and my Lady is still
more eager to go than Maria.</p>

<p>I know not how I made the mistake in saying the annuity
should be £280 instead of £254, but on the receipt of your
letter, I desired Woodcock to make out the conveyance for
£3000 in an annuity at 12 years' purchase (£250) and £4000
on Mortgage at 4 per cent., £160 together with £410. You will
observe that I have somewhat diminished the sum to be laid out
on an annuity and encreased the sum on Mortgage, thinking it
better for you. Unfortunately for you, since the above arrangement,
I have discovered that besides the outgoings I mentioned
to you there is a Fee Farm rent of £5 8<em>s.</em> 0<em>d.</em> payable out of
the Estate, which at 28 years' purchase makes a deduction of
£151 4<em>s.</em> 0<em>d.</em> Be assured that you are a damned Jew, otherwise
you would have been content with the £6700 which I profferred to
you, and I think you ought still. I propose that the annuity
and mortgage interest shall begin from Lady-day ensuing, and
the Deeds shall be sent to you whenever I can prevail on
Woodcock to prepare them. The Annuity shall be payable
out of certain farms at Sheffield, and the £4000 mortgage shall
be on the Newhaven Estate. The Mortgage Deeds, &amp;c., shall
be left in Batt's hands for your account. It is observable
that I am paying you £4000 for the reversion of the Estate,
and in the meantime more than the annual clear income of
it. I am purchasing Lord Heathfield's House and Estate in
Sussex, 14 miles from Sheffield, for Sir Henry Clinton. Only
25 years' purchase, deducting every outgoing, is asked, and the
timber (which will be very advantageous) is rated very moderately.</p>

<p>You have often remarked how singular your ill-luck is as to
sales and titles to Estates. Be it known to you that the conveyance
of the Newhaven Estate to your Grandfather is lost. All the other
old writings belonging to it were found carefully tyed up and
transmitted to me by Mr. Law. The Lawyers say, as I know the
circumstances of the Estate and Family, it is such a title as I may
take if I please. Yet that I should not be able to sell it again
but to disadvantage. I answer that I do not wish it to be sold
again. Thus it appears you could not easily sell to anybody but
me. As to the Buriton business, I have been almost afraid to tell
you that it is still hung up. It is again referred to a Master in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Chancery. However, there is no step neglected that can bring it
to a conclusion, and I hope it cannot hold on much longer. I
have made out that Hugonin was indebted to you to the amount
of a year and a half of Buriton. I have sworn to the account,
and you will receive at least ten shillings in the pound. Hugonin,
his Mistress and daughter are all dead within two years. You will
have £8000 on Mortgage in Hampshire, £4000 in Sussex, and
£4000 in Yorkshire. All good strings to your bow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LABOURING OAR IN THE HOUSE.</div>

<p>The account of your undergoing a drain equal to fifty blisters
furnishes me with some satisfaction, as we think it will be
serviceable to your fat carcase. You have proven me busy, but I
was comparatively at leisure. I have illuminated the Corn Laws.
The subject was not understood. The Pamphlet written in a few
days is in great repute. You will abuse it because I only attended
to the sense in writing it. I have the labouring oar in the House
of Commons. I shall write again soon. In the meantime you
must write by return of post, if you wish any other distribution of
the money.</p>

<p>I am on a Committee every day from ten to four.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, April 9th, 1791.
</p>

<p>I <em>will</em> say no more, because I can say no more on the unfortunate
subject of Buriton, the most unlucky because the least
expected of all my worldly embarrassments. Tell me fairly
whether you suspect any secret management, or any legal
chicanery, &amp;c., on the side of the purchasers. If they are sincere
and willing as ourselves, what hinders that we should give possession,
we of the land and they of the money, and let the Master in
Chancery make his report whenever it may amuse him? If such
a scheme be impracticable, goad, I conjure you, the lawyers and
fix a day, a definite day, a short day for the final conclusion, for
my release from a state of suspense which keeps me hanging
between heaven and earth.</p>

<p>You say nothing of what rent may be due from Newhaven,
and of the payment of my wretched legacy. My repairs and
improvements have now run away with a great deal of money, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
my cash account with the Goslings has seldom been so low. It
would, however, suffice to pay for the Madeira which is arrived in
perfect health: but with my usual accuracy I have lost the account.</p>

<p>After mature consideration I accept your terms of £250
annuity and four thousand mortgage with the security which you
propose; the former on some farms at Sheffield (doubtless of a
more ample produce), the latter on the Newhaven estate, the
imperfect title of which it will not become me to dispute. Notwithstanding
your recent discovery of a fee farm rent, I think
you will still have a very good bargain; but if you are obstinate,
you may strike off ten pounds a year from the Annuity, for your
chance of getting back any money would be a very poor one
indeed.&mdash;With regard to the writings, I have no objection to the
method which you propose of lodging them in Batt's hands. I do
not recollect anything more on the subject of business, since I
have already approved of the distribution of the purchase money.
£8000 on Buriton, £4000 in Yorkshire, the loose residue, if any,
in the funds. We may therefore proceed to more interesting and
less interested topics.</p>

<p>*First, of my health; It is now tolerably restored: my legs are
still weak, but the animal in general is in a sound and lively condition;
and we have great hopes from the fine weather and the
Pyrmont waters. I most sincerely wished for the presence of
Maria, to embellish a ball which I gave the 29th of last month to
all the best company, natives and foreigners, of Lausanne, with
the aid of the Severys, especially of the mother and son, who
directed the &oelig;conomy, and performed the honours of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête</i>.
It opened about seven in the evening; the assembly of men and
women was pleased and pleasing, the music good, the illumination
splendid, the refreshments profuse: at twelve, one hundred and
thirty persons sat down to a very good supper; at two, I stole
away to bed, in a snug corner; and I was informed at breakfast,
that the remains of the Veteran and young troops, with Severy and
his sister at their head, had concluded the last dance about a
quarter before seven. This magnificent entertainment has gained
me great credit; and the expence was more reasonable than you
can easily imagine. This was an extraordinary event, but I give
frequent dinners; and in the summer I have an assembly every
Sunday evening. What a wicked wretch! says Lady Pantile.</p>

<p>I cannot pity you for the accumulation of business, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
ought not to pity <em>me</em>, if I complained of the tranquillity of
Lausanne: we suffer or enjoy the effects of our own choice.
Perhaps you will mutter something of our not being born for ourselves,
of public spirit (I have formerly read of such a thing), of
private friendship, for which I give you full and ample credit, &amp;c.
But your parliamentary operations, at least, will probably expire
in the month of June; and I shall refuse to sign the Newhaven
conveyance, unless I am satisfied that you will execute the
Lausanne visit this summer. On the 15th of June, suppose lord,
lady, Maria, and maid, (poor Louisa!) in a post coach, with
Etienne on horseback, set out from Downing-street, or Sheffield-place,
cross the Channel from Brighton to Dieppe, visit the
national assembly, buy caps at Paris, examine the ruins of
Versailles, and arrive at Lausanne, without danger or fatigue, the
second week in July; you will be lodged pleasantly and comfortably,
and will not perhaps despise my situation. A couple of
months will roll, alas! too hastily away: you will all be amused
by new scenes, new people; and whenever Maria and you, with
Severy, mount on horseback to visit the country, the Glaciers, &amp;c.,
My lady and myself shall form a very quiet tête-à-tête at home.
In September, if you are tired, you may return by a direct or
indirect way; but I only desire that you will not make the plan
impracticable by grasping at too much. In return, I promise you
a visit of three or four months in the autumn of ninety-two: you
and my booksellers are now my principal attractions in England.
You had some right to growl at hearing of my supplement in the
papers: but Cadell's indiscretion was founded on a loose hint
which I had thrown out in a letter, and which in all probability
will never be executed. Yet I am not totally idle. Adieu.*</p>

Downing Street, 21st April, 1791.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BARGAIN WITH THE SHEFFIELDS.</div>

<p>At length the Buriton business is almost concluded, and all
your and my cares on that subject will be at an end, the moment
I receive the Deeds which were sent to you early this morning
for signature. The Masters in Chancery are the Devils, and I
should not have expressed myself much more amiably of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Master of the Rolls, if he had not been at last particularly attentive
to my exhortations to dispatch. All difficulties are at end,
the conveyances, &amp;c., engrossed, and one part of them are gone to
you, because Lord Stawell's Lawyers wish you to sign that part,
notwithstanding they drew up the Power of Attorney which you
signed to enable me.</p>

<p>At the same time are gone the Deeds which convey Newhaven
from Ed. Gibbon to Lord Sheffield, reciting the £4000
on Mortgage and the annuity of £250 per Ann. The conveyance
is to J. T. Batt to the use of Lord Sheffield. Batt
is Trustee; and the Deeds, when returned with the other
writings belonging to the Estate, must be left in his hands as
such, not only on account of the Mortgage of £4000, but also
because the Newhaven Estate is made subject to the Annuity,
notwithstanding a greater proportion of the Sheffield Estate is
chargeable with it than is necessary to pay the whole. It was
unnecessary to send you the Deed which grants the Annuity of
£250 chargeable on Sheffield and Newhaven. It is signed by me
and left in Batt's hands. He has perused and examined the
drafts of the Conveyance and of the grant of the annuity before
they were engrossed.</p>

<p>There are four deeds sent for your signature&mdash;and with them
directions as to the parts where to be signed, which parts are
marked with pencil. It is also mentioned that you should
have English witnesses. Frank North might be one, and I suppose
you may find at any time another fit English witness at
Lausanne. You will despatch as soon as you can and return
the writings immediately. If you give me a line of notice as
soon as they are signed it will be still better, and will forward,
and in reality conclude, matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SNUGNESS OF GIBBON'S AFFAIRS.</div>

<p>We have not been able to get any intelligence of the conveyance
of the Newhaven Estate to your Grandfather, which
is somewhat strange. I mentioned in my last that I had
given directions for forming the conveyance from you to me,
previous to the discovery of a Quit-rent, and that I thought
you had better pay me the value of that Quit-rent than alter
the even sum of £4000 Mortgage or £250 annuity. I must
therefore take 28 years' purchase for the Quit-rent, and I flatter
myself you are too much of a gentleman and too little of the Jew
to make any objection. You have a good bargain, and I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
sooner have seen you at the Devil than have given you so much,
if you did not seem to be under my direction in these matters.</p>

<p>I almost envy you the snugness of your affairs. You will be
a rich fellow. What a damned long letter on such matter, to
make things easy to the meanest capacities.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may write soon on the Russian War, the Slave
Trade, and the Corn Bill. The first has been an extraordinary
business. On the second I was a considerable prop to good
sense against nonsense and the most eloquent declamation on
humanity. What think you of shutting the Ports of the West
Indies? It would not have succeeded better than the experiment
at Boston. I have beaten Pitt 3 times on the Corn Bill.</p>

</p>

<p>Nothing could be more unfair and insidious than the proposition
that you would come here in 1792, if we would go to you
in 1791. It raised the whole Family, and everybody one knows,
against me. It raised me against myself. It is true in a weak
season, when we supposed you poorly, I exhibited a disposition
to go to you, but when you recovered <em>insurmountable</em> difficulties
occurred. The Great Navigation in Sussex which is at its crisis
depends on me, and a thousand other matters, besides expence
when I have not got a shilling to spare. However, the Idea is
entertained. I am much conciliated, as I should be to anything
that binds you to a compact to be here in 1792. I cannot
prevail on myself at once to say&mdash;I will, altho' I apprehend I
must. Therefore say by the return of the post, whether you
can accommodate the Louisa, if she should make a fifth in the
Coach with My Lady, her woman, Maria and myself. I suppose
she might, if necessary, sleep with Maria or the Woman. I
have not mentioned this letter to the Ladies, but Maria is anxious
that Louisa should go, and we think she is at an age to receive
improvement even in a visit for a couple of months. I cannot
go sooner than the beginning of July, and I must be here early
in October. Desire our Friend De Severy to write detail to me
on the subject of the journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>*I write a short letter, on small paper, to inform you, that the
various deeds, which arrived safe and in good condition, have
this morning been sealed, signed, and delivered, in the presence
of respectable and well known English witnesses,* though out of
compliment to you I inserted one Irish evidence, a protégé of

am very well behaved to him. *To have read the aforesaid acts,
would have been difficult; to have understood them, impracticable.
I therefore signed them with my eyes shut, and in that implicit
confidence, which we freemen and Britons are humbly content
to yield to our lawyers and ministers. I hope, however, most
seriously hope, that every thing has been carefully examined, and
that I am not totally ruined. It is not without much impatience
that I expect an account of the payment and investment of the
purchase-money,* and am somewhat afraid of the high charges of
auctioneers and attornies. The writings well secured are delivered
to a trusty carrier, who promises to begin his Journey Monday

<h3><em>To his Stepmother.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 18th, 1791.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,
</p>

<p>*As much as I am accustomed to my own sins, I am
shocked, really shocked, when I think of my long and most
inexcusable silence; nor do I dare to compute how many months
I have suffered to elapse without sending a single line&mdash;(Oh
shame! shame!)&mdash;to the best and dearest of my friends, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
indeed has been very seldom out of my thoughts. I have sometimes
imagined, that if the opportunities of writing occurred less
frequently, they would be seized with more diligence; but the
unfortunate departure of the post twice every week encourages
procrastination, and each short successive delay is indulged without
scruple, till the whole has swelled to a tremendous account.
I will try, alas! to reform; and although I am afraid that writing
grows painful to you, I have the confidence to solicit a <em>speedy
line</em>, to say that you love and forgive me. After a long experience
of the unfeeling doubts and delays of the law, you will probably
soon hear from Lord S. that the Buriton transaction is at last
concluded, and I hope you will be satisfied with the full and
firm security of your annuity. That you may long continue to
enjoy it is the first and most sincere wish of my heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIKE ADAM ALONE IN PARADISE.</div>

<p>In the placid course of our lives, at Lausanne and Bath, we
have few events to relate, and fewer changes to describe; but I
indulge myself in the pleasing belief that we are both as well and
as happy as the common order of Nature will allow us to expect.
I should be satisfied, had I received from time to time some
indirect, but agreeable information of the general state of your
health. For myself, I have no complaint, except the Gout; and
though the visits of my old enemy are longer, and more enfeebling,
they are confined to my feet and knees; the pain is
moderate, and my imprisonment to my chamber, or my chair, is
much alleviated by the daily kindness of my friends. I wish it
were in my power to give you an adequate idea of the conveniency
of my house, and the beauty of my garden: both of which
I have improved at a considerable expence since the death of
poor Deyverdun. But the loss of a friend is indeed irreparable,
and I sometimes feel, that like Adam I am alone in Paradise.
Were I ten years younger, I might possibly think of a female
companion; but the choice is difficult, the success doubtful, the
engagement perpetual, and at fifty-four a man should never think
of altering the whole System of his life and habits. The disposal
of Buriton, and the death of my aunt Hester, who has left me a
small estate in Sussex, makes me very easy in my worldly affairs;
my income is equal to my expence, and my expence is adequate
to my wishes. You may possibly have heard of litterary projects
which are ascribed to me by the public without my knowledge:
but it is much more probable that I have closed the account: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
though I shall never lay aside the pleasing occupations of study,
you may be assured that I have no serious settled thoughts of a
new work. Next year I shall meditate, and I trust shall execute,
a visit to England, in which the Belvidere is one of my powerful
loadstones. I often reflect, with a painful emotion, on the imperious
circumstances which have thrown us at such a distance
from each other.</p>

<p>In the moving picture of the World, you cannot be indifferent
to the strange Revolution which has humbled all that was high,
and exalted all that was low, in France. The irregular and lively
spirit of the Nation has disgraced their liberty, and instead of
building a free constitution, they have only exchanged Despotism
for Anarchy. This town and country are crowded with noble
Exiles; and we sometimes count in an assembly a dozen princesses
and dutchesses. Burke, if I remember right, is no favourite of
yours; but there is surely much eloquence and much sense in his
book. The prosperity of England forms a proud contrast with
the disorders of France; but I hope we shall avoid the folly of
a Russian War. Pitt, in this instance, seems too like his father.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 31st, 1791.
</p>

<p>*At length I see a ray of sunshine breaking from a dark cloud.
Your Epistle of the 13th arrived this morning, the 25th instant,
the day after my return from Geneva; it has been communicated
to Severy; we now believe that you intend a visit to Lausanne
this summer, and we hope that you will execute that intention.
If you are a man of honour, you shall find me one; and, on the
day of your arrival at Lausanne, I will ratify my engagement of
visiting the British isle before the end of the year 1792, excepting
only the fair and foul exception of the Gout. You rejoyce me
by proposing the addition of dear Louisa; it was not without a
bitter pang that I threw her overboard, to lighten the vessel and
secure the Voyage: I was fearful of Mrs. Moss, a second carriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and a long train of difficulty and expence, which might have
ended in blowing up the whole scheme. But if you can bodkin
the sweet creature in the coach, she will find an easy welcome at
Lausanne. The first arrangements which I must make before
your arrival, may be altered by your own taste, on a survey of
the premises, and you will all be commodiously and pleasantly
lodged. You have heard a great deal of the beauty of my house,
garden, and situation; but such are their intrinsic value, that,
unless I am much deceived, they will bear the test even of
exagerated praise. From my knowledge of your Lordship, I
have always entertained some doubt how you would get through
the <em>French</em> society of a Lausanne winter: but I am satisfied that,
exclusive of friendship, your summer visits to the banks of the
Leman Lake will long be remembered as one of the most agreeable
periods of your life; and that you will scarcely regret the
amusement of a Sussex Committee of Navigation in the dog days.
You ask for details: what details? a map of France and a post-book
are easy and infallible guides. If the Ladies are not afraid
of the Ocean, you are not ignorant of the passage from Brighton
to Dieppe: Paris will then be in your direct road; and even
allowing you to look at the Pandæmonium, the ruins of Versailles,
&amp;c., a fortnight diligently employed will clear you from Sheffield-place
to Gibbon Castle. What can I say more?</p>

<p>As little have I to say on the subject of my worldly matters,
which seems now, Jupiter be praised, to be drawing towards a
final conclusion; since, when people part with their money, they
are indeed serious. I do not perfectly understand the ratio of
the precise sum which you have poured into Gosling's reservoir,
but suppose it will be explained in a general account;* as that
reservoir is unproductive, I hope the Yorkshire mortgage will
soon be in motion. I had not a doubt of the Law's (in either
sense of the word) delaying to the last moment the payment of
Hester's paltry legacy, but I conceive that you are in possession
of Newhaven, and that you have obtained for me the year's or
at least the nine months' rent to which I must have been entitled
last Lady-day. I do not perfectly understand whether my share
of Hug, or to what amount, has actually been paid. By this
time you must have received the Deeds.&mdash;<em>Act.</em></p>

<div class="sidenote">BURKE A RATIONAL MADMAN.</div>

<p>*You have been very dutiful in sending me, what I have always
desired, a cut Woodfall on a remarkable debate; a debate, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
most remarkable! Poor Burke is the most eloquent and rational
madman that I ever knew. I love Fox's feelings, but I detest the
political principles of the man, and of the party. Formerly you
detested them more strongly, during the American War, than
myself. I am half afraid that you are corrupted by your unfortunate
connections. Should you admire the National assembly,
we shall have many an altercation, for I am as high an Aristocrate
as Burke himself; and he has truly observed, that it is impossible
to debate with temper on the subject of that cursed Revolution.
In my last excursion to Geneva I frequently saw the Neckers,
who by this time are returned to their Summer residence of
Copet. He is much restored in health and spirits, especially
since the publication of his last book,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> which has probably reached
England. Both parties who agree in abusing him, agree likewise
that he is a man of virtue and Genius: but I much fear that the
purest intentions have been productive of the most baneful consequences.
Our military men, I mean the French, are leaving us
every day for the camp of the princes at Worms, and support
what is called &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> representation. Their hopes are sanguine;
I will not answer for their being well grounded: it is <em>certain</em>,
however, that the emperor had an interview the 19th instant with
the Count of Artois at Mantua; and the Aristocrates talk in
mysterious language of Spain, Sardinia, the empire, four or five
armies, &amp;c. They will doubtless strike a blow this summer:
May it not recoil on their own heads! Adieu. Embrace our
female travellers. A short delay.*</p>

<p>*I now begin to see you all in real motion, swimming from
Brighton to Dieppe, according to my scheme, and afterwards
threading the direct road which you cannot well avoid, to the
turbulent capital of the late Kingdom of France. I know not
what more to say, or what further instructions to send; they
would indeed be useless, as you are travelling through a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which has been sometimes visited by Englishmen: only this let
me say, that, in the midst of Anarchy, the roads were never more
secure than at present. As you will wish to assist at the national

London a good recommendation to some leading member; Cazalès,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
for instance, or the Abbé Maury.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> I soon expect from Elmsly a
cargo of books; but you may bring me any new pamphlets of
exquisite flavour, particularly the last works of John Lord Sheffield,
which the dog has always neglected to send. You will have time
to write once more, and you must endeavour, as nearly as possible,
to mark the day of your arrival. You may come either by Lyons
and Geneva, by Dijon and Les Rousses, or by Dole and Pontarlière.
The post will fail you on the edge of Switzerland, and
must be supplied by hired horses. I wish you to make your last
day's journey easy, so as to dine upon the road, and arrive by tea-time.*
I rejoyce in the approaching conclusion of my affairs,
though the residue of the purchase money has suffered and will
suffer most heavy evacuations.</p>

<p>*The pulse of the contre-Revolution beats high, but I cannot
send you any certain facts. Adieu. I want to <em>hear</em> My lady

Downing Street, Tuesday, 14th June, 1791.
</p>

<p>Your letter of May 31 was received last Friday. As soon as
this letter is finished the Family is to set out for Sheffield Place,
and from thence we shall move as soon as we can towards Lausanne.
We are pressed to pass through France before the Confederation
or Commemoration of the 14th July, and if possible we shall be
with you before that day. I have much to do in Sussex, but I
shall hasten. I shall wish to pass one day at Rouen and three
or four at Paris. I hope to quit Sheffield Place about the 28th
instant. We expect the Borders of France to be troubled, perhaps
Besançon may not be perfectly tranquil. Take care to send
a few lines to meet me at the Post Office, Paris.</p>

<p>Louisa is delighted with your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empressement</i> to see her. All
My Lady's sagacious friends have assured her that it is absolutely
necessary to have two men servants on our Travels. Etienne was
dismissed six months ago on account of his indecorous conduct
towards My Lady's woman. A Swiss was hired in his place, in
Livery, another is now hired out of Livery, both of them of the
neighbourhood of Lausanne. One may be dismissed when we
arrive there, if we can get a place for him.</p>

<p>The chief disagrement I experience is a disappointment about
your £4000 mortgage in Yorkshire. The owner sold the Estate.
However I insist on compensation, he having engaged the money.
I am in treaty about a mortgage near my Yorkshire Estate for
£3000. I must do the best I can with the other £1000. It will
be extravagant to buy into the Stocks. They never will be
higher, and are likely to be lower. If I could get £1000 Subscriptions
in the Lewes Navigation at 5 pr. Ct., it would be well
secured and well paid, but money is too plentiful; I fear I shall
not be able to get it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD SHEFFIELD AN ANTI-DEMOCRAT.</div>

<p>You exceedingly mistake my Politicks. I am as great an
Anti-Democrat as Mr. Burke, and so are most of the party;
but you are deceived by Burke's speeches. I hold the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>

<p>The Ladies are impatient for their voyage. The writings were

morning of the Royal Escape,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and notwithstanding the probable
confusion and warfare that will take place in France, the ardour of
the Ladies to go to you is redoubled. My Lady seems scared lest
prudence should induce me to halt for intelligence, and cannot
endure a delay even for the packet, which will sail on Saturday.
No, we must set out after dinner for Brighton, and sail from thence
to-morrow for Dieppe. This I should not have undertaken if I had
not received a letter from Pelham dated Paris, two days after the
elopement, which mentioned that on the second day all was quiet,
the National Assembly cool and united, but that he should take
care a letter should meet me at Rouen, which would inform me
whether it would be advisable to pass thro' Paris. He thinks it
may not be easy to get from thence. It is probable I shall be glad
to avoid Paris, if so, I may be at Lausanne in a very short time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
especially if I find a tolerable road from Rouen to Fontainebleau.
From thence I have travelled to Dijon and Besançon to Lausanne.
I think there is most danger of difficulty in passing thro' a
considerable garrison such as Besançon. If we can approach you
we shall wish to arrive in the evening at the time you mention.</p>

<p>Finally, such an undertaking just at this moment will not allow
us to be deemed by our acquaintance <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">compos mentis</i>, but we are
going to you and may arrive sooner than this letter. I shall
write from Rouen however, where I shall stop one day at least.</p>

<p>Alas! just after I had finished I heard the King and Queen

<p>*In obedience to your orders, I direct a flying shot to Paris,
though I have not any thing particular to add, excepting that our
impatience is increased in the <em>inverse ratio</em> of time and space. Yet
I almost doubt whether you have passed the sea. The news of the
King of France's escape must have reached you before the 28th,
the day of your departure, and the prospect of strange unknown
disorder may well have suspended your firmest resolves. The
Royal animal is again caught, and all may probably be quiet. I
was just going to exhort you to pass through Brussels and the confines
of Germany; a fair Irishism, since if you read this, you are
already at Paris. The only reasonable advice which now remains,
is to obtain, by means of Lord Gower,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> a sufficiency, or even superfluity,
of forcible passports, such as leave no room for cavil on a
jealous frontier. The frequent intercourse with Paris has proved
that the best and shortest road, instead of Besançon, is by Dijon,
Dole, Les Rousses, and Nyon.* As my larder cannot always be
furnished for the doubtful day of your arrival, I must desire that
you would make your first appearance, not at dinner time, but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">THE CRISIS IN PARIS.</div>

<p>Neither the Royal Flight or Capture prevented or even interrupted
for a day our travels to the Historian. We passed two
nights at sea, and we have passed two nights at the Castle of
Navarre with the Duke of Bouillon, near Evreux, much more to
our satisfaction. Nothing could be more handsome than our
reception there. I was glad of the opportunity of shewing to the
Ladies, the style of living of one of the first men in France, and
at one of the finest places. I came here last night. I have
already had an opportunity of good intelligence. Matters of the
highest consequence are <em>this moment</em> in agitation.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> <em>They</em> are
determined to get rid of the King, but how, is not so easy a
business. Many of his enemies are sorry he was retaken, because
they know not what to do with him (a Council will be appointed).
I believe they would be glad to let him go, if they did not fear
the Parisian mobility. The Judges agree that the Gardes de Corps,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
who acted as couriers, cannot be tried. They will be suffered to
depart whenever it will be safe. As to the Queen, when I said
I was surprised they did not send her home (that is to the Pais
Autrichiennes) to avoid mischief to her Person, and also to avert
a disagreeable demand, I was told there is no doubt that she will
be allowed to go if she pleases. De Bouillé<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> has emitted an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
invitation to Officers and Soldiers to join him. His letter to the
National Assembly might have been well enough for a Captain of
Grenadiers, but it does not smell of the grand Politician. I
understand that scarce a General Officer remains with the Army
on the Austrian Border towards &mdash;&mdash;, and that numbers, even
whole corps of officers, have deserted, but this I know not with any
precision. I think we may go from hence in 4 or 5 days. Matters
are coming to a Crisis&mdash;therefore you may be sure I shall not stay
long lest we should be stopped and not suffered to go from this city,
but I expect an introduction to Cazalès, La Fayette, and some others.</p>

<p>Lausanne has the honour of containing Lady Webster<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> before
this time. People are apt to spoil her. I desire you will not,
because it gives me a great deal of trouble to set her right afterwards.

<p>The system of getting rid of the King will not do. The
night before last the principal men of the Committees, the Chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the National Assembly, about 100 in number, met, and after a
considerable debate, they resolved that the Constitution should be
maintained, and that the person of the King is inviolable. Only
two of them, Messrs. Dumont and Petier, were of a different
opinion, and they argued for a tryal. La Clos,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> the friend of the
Duke of Orleans, the night preceding the Jacobins, vigorously
insisted on a Tyral and a Regency, but it is known that a great
majority of the National Assembly wish to restore the King and
to put him in the situation he held before his flight, and to give
him a Council. The Queen not being a part of the Constitution,
they do not intend to take any notice of her; much management
is necessary to keep the people quiet, and the Chiefs dare not as
yet bring forward moderate measures. The National Guard wish
to get rid of the King. The resolution I mention in the beginning
of this letter is intended to be kept secret as much as possible
for the present. The measure will be carried with some
difficulty. I have scarce a moment. On Monday we attend the
Apotheosis of Voltaire.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> On Tuesday next we go to the National
Assembly for the last time (having the President's Box), and on
Wednesday we talk of setting out for La Suisse, but I must stop
a day or two at Dijon and one or two perhaps at Besançon. We
suppose the Websters lost, because we have not heard from them.</p>

Fishwomen, to scratch and tear one or two to pieces in a cattish

made (as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on m'a dit</i>) the greatest speech that ever was heard.
It was well calculated to inflame Frenchmen, but he forgot to use
any argument, and utterly omitted to shew that the King had
committed any crime against the Law, and finished by moving
that the King should be tried. The word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enragé</i> does not half
describe a French Democrate. The modern men think the speech
has made a great impression, and think matters are not in so good

<p>The truth is, that I attempted to write to you, the day we
arrived here, &amp; found myself unequal to a longer account of
things, than just to say&mdash;we are eighteen Leagues from Lausanne,
&amp; I have made the family lift up their hands &amp; eyes in astonishment,
by wishing to walk back that distance. I ought to express
my Gratitude for all the kindness and attentions we have met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with, during our stay in Switzerland, &amp; if I was less sensible of
it, I could compose a fine speech&mdash;but I can only say, I can feel,
&amp; I hope you will never find me ungrateful. Tuesday we slept
at Avenches &amp; arrived here at two o'clock on Wednesday. If
you wish to know how we amused ourselves on the Road, I
will tell you, by Meditation &amp; Silence. If you wish to know
what was the Subject of our Meditations I will answer for
myself&mdash;Lausanne. Indeed, my Thoughts have not quitted that
place, for five minutes, &amp; I begin to wonder, whether I shall
ever think of any thing else. Our horse, that had one Wooden
&amp; one broken Leg, fell down, &amp; rather damaged a third Leg&mdash;so
that, as Papa thought if any accident should happen to
the fourth, we might find some difficulty in proceeding on our
journey, &amp; being rather indignant at their slow method of
moving, he has dismissed them, rather too precipitately, as we
are now uncertain whether we shall leave this Town to-morrow
or a fortnight hence. No horses to be had at present.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to the Lac de Thun&mdash;the day was very
fine, &amp; we crossed the Lake to Mr. Fischer's house, where we
found his Lady and Mother. We stopped at Mr. de Mulhinen's
house in our return&mdash;&amp; saw Mad<sup>e</sup>. de Mulhinen, who is a very
pleasing Woman. Papa was so much pleased with the Lake that
he lamented very much that he had not persuaded you &amp; Severy
to come with us there &amp; stay two or three days. Perhaps you
might have been inexorable, but I wish the other part of the
scheme had been thought of a little sooner. I liked the expedition
upon the lake very well, but it was not the Lake of Geneva,
nor was the Boat St. J. Legard's; &amp; yet, as there was a Lake

to the disadvantage of the present time. Mr. Coxe

<div class="sidenote">SAFE IN THE LAND OF LIBERTY</div>

<p>I felt a strong inclination to write from Basle, but as you
said, Berne <em>or</em> Basle &amp; not Berne <em>&amp;</em> Basle, I was afraid of being
troublesome. However I take the first moment of my arrival at
the next station from whence you desired to hear from me, to tell
you we are safe in the Land of Liberty, where the People may
sing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ça ira</i> all day &amp; all night, if they like it. Friday, the day
I wrote from Berne, we went to Wyttenbach's house, to see his
curiosities&mdash;&amp; he has made me <em>Wild</em> again about Botany, by
giving me a Collection of Alpine Plants&mdash;so that now, instead of
admiring Nature in general, I have no eyes but for Weeds, &amp; I
have made a considerable Collection in my Journey from Lausanne
here. The Advoyer came before dinner, &amp; from his suit of Black
Powdered Wig &amp; Gold headed cane, I began to be afraid I was
ill, &amp; that the Physician was come to give his Opinion. Mr.
Fischer dined with us, Mr. Fredennick came after dinner, and
they went with us to the Library &amp; walked upon the ramparts.
In a part of the Ditch we saw two of the Sovereign Lords of the
Pays de Vaud. Their Excellencies were very quiet and rather
Rheumatic, but there were two young ones very frisky and
playful.</p>

<p>Saturday. We were rather unfortunate in a very rainy Day&mdash;&amp;
in one of the Springs of the Carriage breaking near Arberg,
which delayed us some time. If it had been a fine day, we
should have been very disagreeable, but as it was impossible to
go to the Island of St. Pierre<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> that day, we made up our minds
very tolerably. Sunday. The Weather was very favorable, &amp;
we went upon the Island, wrote our names in Rousseau's Bed
chamber, returned to Bienne to dinner, &amp; went to Moutier the
same day. Mama had an opportunity of shewing her heroism&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the last three Leagues we performed by moonlight, &amp; Coxe
describes the Road as so narrow, that one Wheel rubs against
the Rocks &amp; the other hangs over the Precipice&mdash;though this
description is poetical, yet there is some foundation for it. We
regretted passing thro' such picturesque scenes in the dark, but
the next day the Country we passed thro' from Moutier to Basle
was exactly the same. I thought after the Tour to the Glaciers,
that I should think nothing equal to that part of the World,
but the Valley of Munster pleased me more than anything I have
seen. Tuesday, we saw the Gardens of Arlesheim, the Library
&amp; the dance of death. Mr. Ochs was the only one of Mr.
Levade's friends who was at Basle&mdash;the others were both in
France. The <em>higgledy-piggledy</em> Party came to Basle on Tuesday
&amp; were very much in our way on the Road. Papa determined
to go to Strasbourgh on the french side of the River, as the
Horses on the other side are quite knocked up by transporting
Aristocrates to Coblentz. The Craven family with their Guardians,
Lord Molyneux and Mr. Nott, took all the horses at the first
Post, &amp; tho' they left Basle two hours before us, when we got
to St. Louis we were obliged to wait an hour and a half, for the
return of the horses&mdash;during which time we amused ourselves by
walking to Huningue&mdash;which I was very glad of, as it gave me
a better Idea of Scarps &amp; Counter-Scarps, Ravelines &amp; Bastions,
than I should have had without it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRANGE CHARM IN SWITZERLAND.</div>

<p>This day's journey was rather long. We left Basle at eight
o'clock &amp; we arrived at Krafft, where we slept, at &frac12; past eleven&mdash;quite
in despair at the dirt of the French Inns; having met
with such excellent ones in Switzerland, we had quite forgot
what a bad Inn was. We are just arrived here to breakfast,
&amp; expect to meet with some information as to the superiority
of Navigation over Land carriage. Papa was so much out of
humour with the delay, occasioned by want of horses upon the
road yesterday, that he is very much inclined to take a Boat
here. The people at Lausanne, judging I suppose by themselves,
assured me I should forget that place by the time I got to
Basle. I am at Strasburgh, which is still farther; and I can
say from Experience, which is the only thing that ever convinces

<h3><em>The Hon. Maria Holroyd to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Coblentz, Oct. 21st, 1791.
</p>

<p>Our Adventures since I wrote from Strasbourgh have been very
numerous, &amp; if every body had been equally disposed with myself
to be entertained with them, they would have lost much of
their unpleasant circumstances. Papa had determined to go from
Strasburgh to Manheim by Rastadt; but the Inn keeper advised
us to go on the other side of the Rhine, as we should find the
Inns all full in Germany &amp; the Post horses very bad. The Rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
was incessant all day &amp; had continued for two days before. We
found the Roads very bad &amp; lost our way in a large forest;
quite dark; amidst many ejaculations from Mama. When we at
last arrived at Girmenheim, where we were to sleep, we found the
Inn quite full. A Commission was there from Manheim to keep
the Rhine in order, who has heard so much lately of Liberty on
both sides, that he had a mind to make the experiment, &amp; has
strayed over the neighbouring meadows, unmindful of the
excellent Caution given to a Brother River&mdash;"Thames, ever while
you live, keep between your banks." We were put into a small
room, where a Company had just finished supper. Travellers are
not often, I imagine, so unfortunate as to go that road, if I may
judge from the astonishment and, I hope, admiration our Appearance
caused. The Doors were opened and the Room was
lined with Spectators, who gazed at us in silence for near a quarter
of an hour&mdash;more to my amusement than Mama's. There was
only one Room where we could sleep&mdash;&amp; we <em>all</em> arranged ourselves
in three Beds, after having quieted some delicate scruples of
Papa's, who proposed sleeping in the Coach&mdash;however by putting
out the Candles nobody found it necessary to blush.</p>

<p>We left this charming place very early, breakfasted at Spire
and arrived at Manheim early enough to see all the Lyons before
dinner. I was much entertained with the Gallery of Pictures in
the Elector's Palace. It was much superior to anything I had
seen. The Library is very handsome. Papa went to the Play in
the evening &amp; made an acquaintance there, who he brought home
with him, &amp; talked Commerce and Agriculture, till near one in
the morning. The next day we went to Mayence, &amp; the day after
saw the Castle, the Provost's house, the Cathedral, &amp;c., and left
Mayence at two o'clock in a very tolerable Boat. But the Wind
was quite contrary, &amp; it was very late when we arrived at
Bingen. Mama did not take a fancy to Navigation in the least.
For my part I enjoyed it very much, as the Banks of the Rhine,
particularly from Bingen to Coblentz, are very picturesque. The
great number of Castles made me imagine myself in the Age of
Chivalry, &amp; I almost persuaded myself I was a distressed Damsel
carried away against my Will. The next thing, of course, was
to expect a brave Knight to set me free, but as none made their
appearance, I was obliged to quit my romantic Ideas, &amp; my
<em>Castles in the Air</em>, of which I had plenty, as well in my head, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
around me. In plain English, I was much pleased with the day's
journey, &amp; Mama was pretty well reconciled to seeing Water all
round her, which was at first a great grievance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COBLENTZ AND WHITE COCKADES.</div>

<p>Our famous Adventures begin here. We arrived at Coblentz<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
at five o'clock last Wednesday, &amp; found every Inn in the Town full
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Panaches blancs</i>. After staying three hours in the Boat, with
difficulty Papa found one Room, with one Bed, without Curtains
&amp; no other furniture of any kind in it. We preferred this to sleeping
in the Boat, the only alternative, &amp; accordingly we females
slept on Mattresses upon the ground. As there were no curtains
it was impossible to admit Papa of the Party, &amp; he remained all
Night in the Boat. The Account that was brought us of the
Room we were to sleep in, was that between forty and fifty Officers
were in two Rooms at each end of ours, which opened with Folding
Doors. Upon a nearer enquiry, the number was reduced
between 10 &amp; 20&mdash;but they are tolerably quiet, considering they
are <em>Frenchmen</em>. Yesterday was passed enquiring for Lodgings, &amp;
by the help of the Duc de Guiche,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> the Woman of the house was
prevailed upon to give us three Garrets, perfectly unfurnished&mdash;but
this we considered as charming accommodation compared to
the <em>higgledy piggledy</em> Style we had been accustomed to&mdash;but the
Ground is still our Bed.</p>

<p>Papa has found out a great deal of amusement for himself.
He was presented yesterday to the Elector,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Monsieur,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Madame,
the Comte d'Artois, the P. of Condé and his Son; to-day he
dined at a very large dinner at the Prince of Nassau's<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>&mdash;&amp; is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
now at the Play in Mad<sup>e</sup>. de Nassau's Box, who was very desirous
of our Company, but Mama is not fond of <em>violent measures</em>.
The Comte de Romanzov<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> is here, Ambassador to the Princes from
the Empress Cat. The Bishop of Arras<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> is not here; but the
Duc de Guiche is every thing that is delightful, &amp; Papa has
not been at a loss for the Bishop. Our amusements may be
mentioned in very few words. We have seen the citadel. We
go from here early to-morrow morning&mdash;in our Boat. The
Weather is very unfavorable to us. Only that you might justly
make the Observation, "If you are sensible of your fault,
why do you continue to offend?" I would apologize for the
length of my Letter. But while you allow me to write to you, I
do not think I have quite left Lausanne&mdash;&amp; I never know how to
leave off. Distribute our Love and comp<sup>ts</sup> properly.</p>

<span class="smcap">Maria T. Holroyd</span>.
</p>

<p>I forgot to say we found our Letters here. Mama desires her
Love to Severy &amp; many thanks for his Letter. I have taken a
great deal of pains to persuade her to write to him; but she has
not resolution enough to take up her pen. I must whisper to
you we were disappointed at not hearing a few lines from you.</p>

Brussels, October 29th, 1791.
</p>

<p>It is probable that this my fourth Letter may remain unopened
in your Pocket, but I shall leave that to Fate, &amp; only think of
convincing you, that I still remember Lausanne &amp; my promise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
I like to let People know how <em>unreasonable</em> I am, &amp; therefore I
will tell you I had faint hopes of finding a few Lines here, either
written or dictated by you. I frequently ask Mama, do you think
they are talking of us at Lausanne? &amp; she generally answers&mdash;I
daresay not; so I should have had a great deal of satisfaction
in shewing her, that you thought so much of us as to make a
<em>violent effort</em> to tell us so. We have proceeded on our journey
with great success from Coblentz to Brussells, &amp; to-morrow go
to Antwerp. We arrived here on Thursday from Louvain&mdash;the
Road was so bad &amp; the Post-horses moved in such a <em>Swiss</em>
manner, that we were four days coming from Cologne.</p>

<p>The first day we slept at Juliers, the second at Liège, the third
at Louvain, &amp; the fourth (as I had the <em>honour</em> of telling you) we
came to Brussells, &amp; fortunately arrived at 'L'Imperatrice,' the
only Hotel where there was a single Room unoccupied, just as
the Princesse de Salms was moving off&mdash;&amp; took possession of
her apartments with great satisfaction, as we expected Coblenz
accomodations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SIGHTS OF BRUSSELS.</div>

<p>We stayed but one night at Cologne, as the Maréchal de
Castries was not there, &amp; the Town possessed no other Charms
to tempt us to stay, for it is the most dismal place I have seen.
The Maréchal is here, &amp; Papa has had a long conference with
him. Luckily for us, Papa has neither met with a Quarter
Master nor a Commercial man, nor a Farmer here, so we have
seen a great deal and been very much amused. We saw the
Palace of the Archduchess, a league out of Town, yesterday&mdash;&amp;
it is fitted up with more Taste than any thing we have seen in
our travels. The rest of our time has been spent in Churches, the
Arsenal, &amp; some good Collections of Pictures. I have not time to
be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prolix</i> in my narration, which you will perhaps not be sorry for,
as you are not as fond of a long letter as I am. Mama is pretty
well, but will not be sorry to find herself at her own fire side
again.</p>

<p>Remember us to those who remember our existence&mdash;you will
not have much trouble, for I suppose you will only deliver the
message to yourself&mdash;I suspect nobody else of thinking of us.
Louisa desires I will not forget her best Comp<sup>ts</sup> to <em>M. Mentrond</em>;
she does not choose to suppose he can <em>forget her</em>. I expect to hear
a great deal of <em>Mrs. Wood</em>&mdash;or if any body else has supplied her

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Calais, 5th Nov., 1791.
</p>

<p>After various and sundry embarrassments, here we are safe.
The pleasure of the visit being over and the sorrow of departure
come on, it naturally occurred in aid of my concern what a
damned Fool I was to undertake such an operation. To correct
such cogitation, the <em>distractions</em> of the Rhine were some relief.
The state of its neighbourhood is at this time very interesting.
It was curious to find the Princes and prime Nobility of France
thankfull to be allowed to exist on a small angle formed by the
Moselle and the Rhine. An army of officers, but not a common
man. For the sake of visiting the Garrisons of Alsace, I went
the whole length of that Province. Levade's letters were of
essential service to me. I thankfully wrote to him when I had
proceeded far down the Rhine. Probably I furnished some
details, with which he probably has furnished you. I know not
whether I mentioned that Huninge and Brisach are in good condition.
An incompleat Regiment of two battalions in each place
and some Dragoons, not sufficient garrisons, but some cantoned
Troops might be thrown in if required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MILITARY FORCES ON FRENCH FRONTIER.</div>

<p>The Regulars at Strasburgh are 6760, including 1100 Horse
and 1300 artillery. They say they have some 7000 National
Guards, I doubt it. They are the best I have seen; and yet they
are very poor stuff for Soldiers, and many are not cloathed.
I dined with the Colonel of Carbineers, and saw the finest
regiment of France in detail, and also a Swiss Regiment (Viguier),
one of the best. Some of the regiments are not more soldier-like
than the National Guards. The Democrates say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
officers, being Aristocrates, neglect the men on purpose, and
wish the regiments to be ruined; 40 officers had quitted one
regiment in Alsace. In short, only seven remained with it,
including the Colonel. The Park of Artillery at Strasburgh
seems very compleat. It is the second in the Kingdom. A
Train is ready for 40 Battalions. The Province of Alsace is at
least half Aristocrate. I passed the evening and supped at the
Mayor's while at Strasburgh. He and his Lady (a clever dame)
thorough Republicans. Observe the Regulars in the two departments
of the Rhine are commanded by a German,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and the
National Guards by a Lt.-Colonel who is a Livonian. Mirabeau's
Corps seems a miserable collection; several deserters came from it
while I was at Strasburgh. Finally I flattered myself there would
be a compleat <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brouillerie</i> between the regulars and the National
Guards before I left that place. The officers of the latter are
naturally disposed to be very absurd. The double pay of these
troops <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soldès</i> is likely to have an excellent effect on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Troupes
de ligne</i>. I found about 100 French officers at Manterin. Towards
900 at Worms. Bouillé and a certain number are at Mayence.</p>

<p>Including upwards of 900 of the Gardes du Corps and near
20 Generals, there are 2500 Officers at Coblentz. I was very
graciously received by the Princes. They give a supper every
night, where I had the amusement of being introduced to Marshal
Broglie,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> &amp;c., &amp;c. The Prince of Condé and Duc de Bourbon
were there on a visit. Romanzov has brought credentials and
two millions of livres French from the Empress; Calonne is at
Baths not far distant for his health; Burke's son had been sometime
at Coblentz and was gone to England with Cazalés. Our
King has written a very amicable letter to the Princes promising
neutrality. I went to Cologne to see the Marshal de Castries.
He was gone to Brussels, where I found him. At every inn I
found 20 or 30 French Officers, the road is covered with them
from Brussels to Coblentz. Nothing can be worse timed than this
desertion. It is a Phrenzy and was like wildfire. They would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
be much better with their regiments and ready in the country to
protect Friends and to avail themselves of circumstances. The
most sensible of the French disapprove this migration. The
officers leave their Regiments without concert with the Princes,
who have not lately encouraged it. There seems to be no particular
plan at present but to wait events. I unfortunately
missed the Abbé Maury passing to Coblentz. I wished to know
him. He is a Cardinal <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in petto</i>. He is to have the Arch-Bishop
of Sens's Hat. The regular regiments were long ago ordered to
be completed to the war establishment, but on an average they
have not above half their complements, and on the frontier of
the Low Countries there is not an officer left except Soldiers of
Fortune.</p>

<p><em>L'Esprit de Revolution</em> is not likely to flourish again for some
time in the Pais Bas. I found Imperial and Electoral troops in
possession of Liège, and new taxes laid to pay expenses, viz. on
Dogs, Servants, bachelors, &amp;c. The Discontents in the Austrian
Netherlands are not likely to be of much consequence, a great
part of the country was miserably duped and the whole thrown
into such an execrable state, that none but the lowest of the
creation can wish for another experiment at a Revolution. The
leading party among the enemies of the House of Austria being
Clergy and Aristocrates cannot coalesce easily with the Democrates
of France. All the Provinces except Brabant are content.
Many say a counter-revolution in France is impossible, because
the Mass of the People are of one mind. Not near so much as
the Austrian Netherlands were. There almost every man was
a Patriot, yet the moment an army appeared there was not a
struggle. The different extent of country, &amp;c., prevent a correct
comparison.</p>

<p>However, it may be observed that France has not a neighbour
that is not unfriendly to the Revolution. I have the worst
opinion of the French Army. The National Guard behaved
execrably at Nancy, where alone they have been tried. We
indeed were told the contrary. Some Swiss officers (Democrates)
who acted against the regiment of Chateau Vieux<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> have given me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
details. You may be sure that the Regulars and National Guards
will not agree. I am satisfied that of those officers who remain
with the Regiments, almost all except soldiers of fortune are
aristocrates. The soldiers do <em>not desert</em>, but they say they will go
to Paris. They will enter into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardes Nat. soldès</i>, and they
go where they please; nobody can stop them. Yet with such a
King the situation of the Aristocrates is very difficult. Divisions
will naturally take place, the Kingdom is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en traine</i> to be torn to
pieces. A foreign army on the Frontier or advancing to Paris
might unite them, therefore it may be better to wait events. At
the same time I have not a notion that a French army would
fight under its present circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MEETING AT PILNITZ.</div>

<p>It was a comfort to see the excellent Bohemian and Hungarian
Infantry in the Austrian Netherlands. They are in fine
order. The Treaty of the 23rd of July last between the Emperor
and the King of Prussia has been well concealed.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> It is defensive.
The supposition is that Prussia is dissatisfied with England. If
Russia should accede to the Treaty (which is not thought unlikely),
we shall be compleatly left in the lurch.</p>

<p>Maria has been alert and well-disposed to your correspondence.
She seemed pleased with the office, but she will expect an
answer. She has saved me from writing sooner. From Brussels
we went to Antwerp, Ghent, Bruges, Ostende, and Dunkirk to
this place. Mi Ladi continues the same. I should have stopped
more than three days at Brussels if I had not been afraid of
the division of Mrs. Maynard. Say everything kind for us to
the de Severy family. If Mi Ladi does not reply soon to the
Fils, I shall. I found letters at Brussels by which I learn that
your £2000 is accepted by the Navigation Society, that Mr. Taylor
has found a mortgage for £5000 in Yorkshire. He says somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of its being more convenient if the money is not paid till a little
time hence, and I also learn that my worldly affairs, and the
Navigation, have gone on as badly as might be expected from my
absence.</p>

<p>Remember us to Mrs. Grevers.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>579.</h2>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="center">[Incomplete in original.]</p>

<p>The increase of Mi Ladi's woman, and apprehensions thereon,
made it necessary to shorten my visits. You have heard of
the little accident on board the Packet. You know dear Puff
has a great dislike to cats. About midnight, midway between
France and England, an hideous noise like that of a cat in the
act of being strangled was heard. Puff barked and was furious.
I looked out of my den, and beheld it was an human kitten
that proceeded from Mrs. Maynard who was prostrate on the
floor. My Lady also incumbent there. Maria contemplative
and Louisa astonished. Not a creature on board the Packet
but ourselves and the crew. We never know what we may come
to, and above all we should not have guessed that Mi Ladi
was to become a mid-wife. The mother and child could not
have been better, (and have continued so,) if all the obstetric
Faculty of Paris and London had attended. The mother was so
well that she expressed the greatest anxiety to go with us the day
following above 80 miles across the country to this place. We
left her in good lodgings and in good care. The want of her
prevented the Ladies from passing two days at Lord Guilford's.
We found two letters from him at Dover and a dozen messages.
I went and had a pleasant dinner with him, and returned at night
to the Ladies.</p>

<p>I must now come to the unpleasant part, your business.
Immediately on my return I wrote to Taylor about the £5000
mortgage. I have a letter full of disappointment. The person
to be paid off has accepted low interest. He complains of being
frequently thus treated. Don't bother yourself. I still hope
soon to settle the business.</p>

</p>

<p>It is with a mixture of satisfaction &amp; regret, that I complete
my part of our engagement in writing this Letter. I find
great pleasure in being returned to dear, precious Sheffield, &amp; in
telling you so, because I am sure you will be glad to hear we are
safe and well; but writing to you the last letter is like a second
taking leave, &amp; tho' I have been near six weeks upon the
journey from Lausanne, that moment is still as fresh in my
memory as it was the next day, &amp; the recollection of it as
unpleasing. If I <em>dared</em> I would ask to be allowed to tell you we
were alive, now &amp; then when Papa &amp; Mama were in an idle
mood, &amp; to be allowed to <em>hope</em> for an answer <em>once</em> in <em>two</em> or <em>three
years</em>, in your own hand or not, as you thought proper or found
convenient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISTRESSES UPON THE SEA.</div>

<p>I was very glad Papa wrote a long letter from Calais, as his
information about things in general would be more interesting
to you than mine, as I suppose he gave you a full account
of our route from Brussells to Calais. I will only tell you that
I was very much amused at Antwerp, &amp; that I <em>catch</em> myself,
now &amp; then, <em>making believe</em> to know a good Picture from a
bad one&mdash;having seen so many excellent ones lately. We left
Calais last Sunday at 9 in the morning, having waited three days
for a favorable wind, &amp; at last in despair, set off in a perfect
Calm, which prolonged our passage 24 hours&mdash;which was uncommonly
tedious, &amp; very bad luck, as our Passage from Brighton
was as tiresome in coming over. However to pass the time, or to
diversify the amusements of the Passage, which from the sickness
of the Company would have preserved some degree of sameness,
Mrs. Maynard with Mama's assistance, half way between Calais
&amp; Dover, presented the cabbin boy with a <em>Sea Nymph</em>; which
with its Mother are now <em>as well as can be expected</em>, at Cap<sup>n</sup> Sampson's
house at Dover. I have heard that Sailors, when they come
from a voyage, find great pleasure in talking of &amp; recollecting
Toils &amp; Dangers past&mdash;such is our case; for we have laughed
very heartily here, at our Distresses upon the Sea&mdash;which certainly
at the time was no laughing matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>We found the inhabitants of S. P. in excellent preservation
&amp; quite rejoyced to see us returned&mdash;most of them, when we
left England, being convinced we should be all massacred by
the National Assembly in a very short time. I hope the quiet
life of this place will soon restore Mama's health &amp; spirits, who
desires her kindest remembrances to you &amp; those we love at
Lausanne. Do not let anybody forget us, for we forget nobody.</p>

<p>My Lady is getting quite well. Bratts very fond of their
Swiss Tour. I have passed a week very pleasantly in London.
King apparently quite well. Lally a great favourite with Lord
Loughborough. He assisted at a copious dinner at Batt's, and
said he never enjoyed one more interesting. He saw Lord
Guilford on his passage through London, who was well pleased
with him, as also is Douglas. Tell Mr. Trevor good care will be
taken of him. La Comtesse de Lally seems to preserve a strict
incognito. Lady Loughborough visits her. I can only collect
that she doth not appear to like to go out. It is said, she has not
confined her practices to Lally. Introduced him to Burke, who
says the said Lally persists in his errors, and justifies all his
mischievous conduct in the beginning, and the said Burke is as
ridiculous and as absurd as may be imagined.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> I have been presented
to Cazalés (who resides with Burke), but I had not an
opportunity of seeing anything of him. England has supplied
and has been paid for 36,000 stand of arms for the Emigrants.
The Corps Diplomatique at London says that Spain has sent
5 millions of livres to the Princes, and Portugal 4 millions&mdash;Berlin
2 millions.</p>

I hope also to see him here. People begin to talk of 3&frac12; per Cent.

<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 25th Dec., 1791.
</p>

<p>I am obliged to write to you, otherwise it would not be
proper, because we are determined to starve you into a more
decent deportment; not a fragment from you except the medley
to Maria. She has been so zealous in your service, that she
deserved more notice. The obligation to write is that a pipe of
Madeira (which has travelled and is very good) is ordered to set
out for Lausanne by the same consignment and way as the last,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i> you must give notice to your correspondent at Basle, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARRIAGE, BATTLE, FIRE, AND SCANDAL.</div>

<p>Nothing extraordinary has occurred in this family since my
last. My Lady is better. We expect Batt to-morrow, probably
Lally, and also Mr. Levade's son-in-law, with whom I have corresponded.
The Duchess of York<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> almost smothered the French
Revolution in this country; Lord Cornwallis's operations<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> almost
suppressed the Duchess of York, and I daresay the Duke of Richmond's
fire<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> has afforded some relief to Lord Cornwallis. I should
be happy to furnish you with as much scandal as possible, but I
know of no event of the kind worth record, unless Lady Belmore's<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
trip to the Continent incontinently with Lord Ancrum should be
deemed so, and Lady Tyrconnell's<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Flight to Glamis Castle with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Lord Strathmore. These amiable women have left behind them
grown daughters. May the Mamas&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I have secured for you the famous Shakespear; Boydel<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> is
satisfied that I subscribed for two setts. It is by far the finest
book ever printed. I have your first number and 5 large and 5
small prints in my possession, but I shall not send them&mdash;you
must come for them.</p>

<p>As you care nothing about the good of the nation, it is almost
unnecessary to mention that the gross produce of the Permanent
Revenue last year, including Land and Malt, amounted to
£20,355,380 exclusive of fines, forfeitures, Taxes on Places, First
Fruits, &amp;c., amounting to £125,476 and the profit of the
Lottery. The Gross Excise last year £9,054,850, encrease this
year £1,200,000, of which £800,000 are old and £400,000 new
Duties. The British Shipping has increased 318,522 tons since
1773. The whole tonnage of France is not much more than a
fourth more. Their tonnage in 1787 was little more than a fifth
of ours.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> has been marching about in Tippoo's country
for six weeks to prove that it was not the monsoon that obliged
him to quit Seringapatam. Was it not a curious omission to have
neither a minister nor a spy in the Maratta Camp, and was it not
an extraordinary folly to risk an engagement for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of besieging Seringapatam 9 days before there was an absolute
famine in the English Camp? Abercrombie's cattle were all
swept away by Tippoo's General, and neither Abercrombie nor
any of his officers have a second coat or shirt.</p>

<p>We never had cavalry in an Indian Army before. It was the
great strength of this famous army. It is all ruined.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, December 28th, 1791.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DEMON OF PROCRASTINATION.</div>

<p>*Alas! alas! the Demon of procrastination has again possessed
me. Three months have nearly rolled away since your departure;
and seven letters, five from the most valuable Maria, and two
from Yourself, have extorted from me only a single epistle, which,
perhaps, would never have been written, had I not used the permission
of employing my own tongue and the hand of a secretary.
Shall I tell you, that, for these last six weeks, the eve of every
post day has witnessed a <em>firm</em> resolution, and the day itself has
furnished some ingenious delay? This morning, for instance, I
had determined to invade you as soon as the breakfast things
should be removed: they were removed; but I had something to
read, to write, to meditate, and there was time enough before me.
Hour after hour has stolen away, and I finally begin my letter at
two o'Clock, evidently too late for the post, as I must dress, dine,
go abroad, &amp;c. A foundation, however, <em>shall be</em> laid, which will
stare me in the face; and next Saturday I shall probably be
rowzed by the awful reflection that it is the last day in the year.</p>

<p>After realizing this summer an event which I had long considered
as a dream of fancy, I know not whether I should rejoyce
or grieve at your visit to Lausanne. While I possessed the family,
the sentiment of pleasure, with some occasional shades, highly
predominated; and the last weeks of harmony and content were
those which I the most truly enjoyed, when, just as we had subsided
in a regular, easy, comfortable plan of life, the last trump
sounded, and, without speaking of the pang of separation, you left
me to one of the most gloomy, solitary months of October, which
I have ever passed.</p>

<p>For yourself and daughter, however, you have contrived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
snatch some of the most interesting scenes of this World.
Paris, at such a moment, Switzerland, and the Rhine, have
suggested a train of lively images and useful ideas, which will
not be speedily erazed. The mind of the young Damsel, more
especially, will be enlarged and enlightened in every sense;
in four months she has lived many years; and she will much
deceive and displease me, if she does not review and methodize
her journal, in such a manner as she is capable of performing, for
the amusement of her particular friends. Another benefit which
will redound from your recent view is, that every place, person,
and object, about Lausanne, are now become familiar and interesting
to you. In our future correspondence (do I dare
pronounce the word correspondence?) I can talk to you as
freely of every circumstance as if it were actually before your
eyes.</p>

<p>And first, of my own improvements.&mdash;All those venerable piles
of ancient verdure which you admired, have been eradicated in
one fatal day. Your faithful substitutes, William de Severy and
Levade, have never ceased to persecute me, till I signed their
death warrant. Their place is now supplied by a number of
picturesque naked poles, the foster fathers of as many twigs of
platanuses and acacias, which may afford a grateful but distant
shade to the founder, or to his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seris nepotibus</i>. In the meanwhile
I must confess that the terrace appears broader, and that I discover
a much larger quantity of snow than I should otherwise do.
The workmen admire your ingenious plan for cutting out a new
bed-chamber and book-room; but, on mature consideration, we
all unanimously prefer the old scheme of adding a third room
beyond the library, with two spacious windows, and a fire-place
between, on the Terrace. It will be larger (28 feet by 21), and
pleasanter, and warmer: the difference of expence will be much
less considerable than I imagined: the door of communication
with the library will be artfully buried in the wainscot; and,
unless it be opened by my own choice, may always remain a
profound secret. Such is the design; but as it will not be
executed before next summer, you have time and liberty to state
your objections. I am much colder about the staircase, but it
may be finished, according to your idea, for thirty pounds; and I
feel they will persuade me. Am I not a very rich man? When
these alterations are compleated, not forgetting the watercloset,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
few authors of six Volumes in quartos will be more agreeably
lodged than myself.</p>

<p>Lausanne is now full and lively; all our native families are
returned from the Country; and, praised be the Lord, we are
infested with few foreigners, either French or English. Even
our Democrates are more reasonable or more discreet; it is
agreed to wave the subject of politics, and we all seem happy
and cordial. I have a grand dinner this week, a supper of
thirty or forty people on Twelfth-day, &amp;c.; some concerts
have taken place, some balls are talked of; and even Maria
would allow (yet it is ungenerous to say even Maria) that the
winter scene at Lausanne is tolerably gay and active. I say
nothing of the Severys, as Angletine has epistolized Maria last
post. She has probably hinted her brother meditates a short
excursion to Turin; that worthy creature Trevor has given him a
pressing invitation to his own house. Mrs. Trevor, who is one of
us, does not envy him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE OR WAR IN EUROPE?</div>

<p>In the beginning of February I propose going to Geneva
for three or four weeks. I shall lodge and eat with the Neckers;
my mornings will be my own, and I shall spend my evenings
in the society of the place, where I have many acquaintance.
This short absence will agitate my stagnant life, and restore
me with fresh appetite to my house, my library, and my friends.
Before that time, the end of February, what events may happen,
or be ready to happen! The National assembly<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> (compared to
which the former was a Senate of heroes and Demigods) seem
resolved to attack Germany <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avec quatre millions de bayonettes
libres</i>; the army of the princes must soon either fight, or starve,
or conquer. Will Sweden draw his sword?<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> will Russia draw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
purse?<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> an empty purse! All is darkness and anarchy: neither
party is strong enough to impose a settlement; and I cannot
see a possibility of an amicable arrangement, where there are
no heads (in any sense of the word) who can answer for the
multitude. Send me your ideas, and those of Lord Guildford,
Lord Loughborough, Fox, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, a word of my vexatious affairs.&mdash;Shall I
never sail on the smooth stream of good security and half-yearly
interest? Will every body refuse my money? I had already
written to Darell and Gosling to obey your commands, and was in
hopes that you had already made large and salutary evacuations.
During your absence I never expected much effect from the cold
indifference of agents; but you are now in England&mdash;you will be
speedily in London; set all your setting dogs to beat the field,
hunt, enquire,&mdash;why should you not advertise? And let not the
Goslings dine at my expence. I know not what to say at present
of India bonds&mdash;do they not Sink? Our affairs in that Country
seem in a very ticklish situation. At all events consult with
Darrel, he has knowledge of that sort and is a real friend.
Yet I am almost ashamed to complain of some stagnation of
interest, when I am witness to the natural and acquired philosophy
of so many French, who are reduced from riches, not to indigence,
but to absolute want and beggary. A Count Argout has just left
us, who possessed ten thousand a-year in the Island of St.
Domingo;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> he is utterly burned and ruined; and a brother, whom
he tenderly loved, has been murdered by the Negroes. These are
real misfortunes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN AMAZING PUSH OF REMORSE.</div>

<p>I have much revolved the plan of the Memoirs I once
mentioned; and, as you do not think it ridiculous, I believe
I shall make an attempt: if I can please myself, I am confident
of not displeasing; but let this be a profound secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
between us: people must not be prepared to laugh; they must
be taken by surprize. Have you looked over your, or rather my
letters? Surely in the course of the year, you may find a safe
and cheap occasion of sending me a parcel; they may assist me.
Adieu. I embrace My Lady: send me a favourable account of
her health and spirits. How happy might we have been, could
she have preserved them at Lausanne! I kiss the Marmaille. By
an amazing push of remorse and diligence I have finished my
letter, three pages and a half, this same day since dinner; but I
have not time to read it. Ever yours.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, December 31st, 1791.<br />
To-morrow a new year, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multos et felices</i>.
</p>

<p>*I now most sincerely repent of my late repentance, and do
almost swear never to renounce the amiable and useful practice
of procrastination. Had I delayed, as I was strongly tempted,
another post, your missive of the 13th, which did not reach me
till this morning (three mails were due), would have arrived in
time, and I might have avoided this second Herculean labour. It
will be, however, no more than an infant Hercules. The topics of
conversation have been fully discussed, and I shall now confine
myself to the needful of the new business. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Felix faustumque
sit!</i> May no untoward accident disarrange your Yorkshire
Mortgage; the conclusion of which will place me in a clear and
easy state, such as I have never known since the first hour of
property.*</p>

<p>Considering the fragment which we had recovered from
Hugonin's shipwreck, and the large autumnal payments, I should
have imagined that the Goslings would have been somewhat
fatter: your lawyers' bills, the last (as I flatter myself) that I
shall ever know, must have cut deeper than you expected; but I
shall see the detail of their account. If the Yorkshire friend
should like £6000 instead of £5000, and if the estate would afford
adequate and ample security, why should you not desire Darrel to
sell the amount of £3800? I should then have exactly £20,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
firmly seated on land and water, besides your annuity of £250,
and I would not touch the moderate residue of my short annuities,
till poor Mrs. G.'s dismission from below (which cannot be a
very distant event) shall release me from her annual tribute
of £300.</p>

<p>*The three per cents are so high, and the country is in such a
damned state of prosperity under that fellow Pitt, that it goes
against me to purchase at such low interest. In my visit to
England next autumn, or in the spring following, (alas! you <em>must</em>
acquiesce in the alternative,) I hope to be armed with sufficient
materials to draw upon Cadell for a loose sum of £1000 perhaps or
£1500, which may be employed as taste or fancy shall dictate, in
the improvement of my library, a service of plate, &amp;c. I am not
very sanguine, but surely this is no uncomfortable prospect.</p>

<p>This pecuniary detail, which has not indeed been so unpleasant
as it used formerly to be, has carried me farther than I expected.
Let us now drink and be merry. I flatter myself that your Madeira,
improved by its travels, will set forwards for Messrs. Romberg, at
Ostend, early in the spring; and I should be very well pleased if
you could add a hogshead of excellent claret, for which we should
be entitled to the Drawback. They must halt at Basle, and send
notice to me for a safe conduct. Have you had any intelligence
from Lord Awkland about the wine which he was to order from
Bourdeaux, by Marseilles and the Rhone? The one need not
impede the other; I wish to have a long stock. Corea has
promised me a hogshead of his native Madeira, for which I am to
give him an order on Cadell for a copy of the Decline and Fall:
he vanished without notice, and is now at Paris. Could you not
fish out his direction by Mrs. Wood, who by this time is in
England? I rejoice in Lally's prosperity, but cannot think
Burke so very mad. Have you reconsidered my proposal of a
declaration of constitutional principles from the heads of the
party? I think a foolish address from a body of Whigs to the
national assembly renders it still more incumbent on you. The
intelligence of my Lady's amendment has given us all most
heartfelt pleasure. How very unlucky was the moment! Achieve
my worldly concerns, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et eris mihi magnus Apollo</i>. Adieu, ever
yours.*</p>

<h2>585.</h2>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 16th January, 1792.
</p>

<p>The circumstance of your being already damned (in the opinion
of all good people) has often checked expectoration, and has often
been so far inconvenient as to deprive me of an Exordium, which
occasion and fine feelings inspired. I have been boiling for some
time, and was meditating some eminent degree of abuse when your
letters of the 28th and 31st ultimo arrived this morning. They
have so far softened, as to save me the trouble of examining your
impudent excuses. Seven to one are great odds, especially in
letter writing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CAPACITY OF MARIA HOLROYD.</div>

<p>As to Lausanne, I do not like to talk of my visit there. I do
not think I enjoyed it half enough. It is true I contrived to
snatch some of the most interesting scenes of this world. France
and Paris at such a moment&mdash;the truly Sovereign Proceedings of
Berne.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> It was a comfort to see the whiskered Germans, that
excellent contrast to the French National Guards. The Rhine
and Austrian Flanders, though last, did not promote and assist
less lively images or less usefull ideas. The young ladies are still
full of their excursion, and they seem even more delighted with
the recollection than they were with the enjoyment. I am glad
you recommended to Maria to review and methodise her journal.
Her capacity, if well directed, is equal to anything. I hear a
superlative account from various parts of the letters she wrote to
England. I have not seen them. I hear a good deal also of my
own, and I wish I had some long letters I wrote to the Duke of
Portland, Lord Guilford, and Lord Loughborough. I have no
journal or memoranda of the subjects of them.</p>

<p>We have had some extra encitements to think of Lausanne.
First came Francillon, smart, pleasing, and attentive, and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
he has not a very imposing Parsonick gravity, I think I discover
that he is a diligent pastor. There is a small matter which I
flatter myself I may be able to do for him by means of the
Arch-Bishop of Canterbury. N.B.&mdash;Levade's letter was a great
treat to us, and Lavater's manuscript is considered by the Family
as an acquisition. I shall write to the former speedily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LALLY TOLLENDAL AT COURT.</div>

<p>Francillon stayed here about ten days, but before his departure,
the Lally Tollendal arrived. That lively, miserable,
pleasant, mortified, pious, and ingenuous man has been here
above a fortnight, and what is still more miraculous, he does
not seem to have the least disposition to go; and yet I have
walked him on foot over ploughed fields when very wet, and
I have trotted him on horseback in the roughest lanes when
frozen as hard as possible. He is delighted with the Library,
where he finds a great variety of books he had not seen. He
has made exhilirating discoveries in respect to Strafford,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and
he is become the most profound Antiquarian in Parliamentary
history that I know. As it is not customary for him to wear
breeches until he goes out, which is always late, or until he
comes to dinner, I have just received a note from his apartment,
which states that not being in condition to enter the
Library (Mrs. Poole in her 83rd year is there) he prays me
to send him certain folios. Poor fellow, his nerves are in a
horrid state, but he says not worse than they have generally
been since he had the small pox. Tell Mrs. Trevor I am particularly
attentive to his health. I recommend regular meals
instead of one enormous dinner, and earlier times of going to and
rising from bed, to which in some degree he attends. My Lady,
(who is infinitely better) takes to him amazingly, but that seems
the custom with all Ladies. I have only one objection to him,
namely, he reads in Bed and is eminently <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i>; I am sorry, as
it is a rule with me never to solicit a second visit from a person
who has that practice, because there is some inconvenience in
having the house burnt down in the middle of the night, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
it could be so contrived that all the inhabitants should be burnt
at the same time without knowing anything of the matter. I
wish his Malkin was re-established at Tournay&mdash;and so I believe
does he. The expectations from the uncles are not flattering. I
fancy he would like best to be with his Princesses of the Desert
and Madame Trevor. Lord Loughborough is extremely pleased
with him and is uncommonly kind to him. Lord Guilford likes
him, and Lally was much satisfied with his visit of two days to
Bushey Park. The King took a great deal of notice of him, and
talked to him a long time. They conversed on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Renversement
de toutes les Idées que caracterisait La Revolution Francaise</i>. Lally
said, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Sire, Je quitte un des sujets de vôtre Majestie et certainement
des plus distingués. Il a caracterisè à merveille par une seule
plaisanterie ce que nous arrive." "Qui?" "M. Gibbon." "Et
que dit il?" "Il dit, que la Revolution Francaise lui rappelle le
tems de son enfance, où on lui faisait voir dans une grande estampe
un cochon faisant rôtir un Cuisinier."</i> Lally adds, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sa Majestie
Brittanique a ri de ce rire inextinguible que Homer nous donne
pour un attribut des Dieux.</i>"</p>

<p>Finally, the Count is likely to pass his time in London as well
as can be expected in his burdened state. Everybody interests
themselves about him. Yet I can discover no symptom of a commodious
arrangement for him. I thought he would have gone to
the Queen's Naissance,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> but I think he will now stay here till
Parliament meets, viz. the 31st instant. On his passage to this
Island, he had a long conversation with De Bouillè at Mayence.
You will remember I have abused that general for not attempting
to retake the King. I was unjust. He followed him with one
thousand cavalry nine leagues in what is stated an incredibly
short time (yet four hours are mentioned), and was stopped by a
river,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> like Lord Cornwallis going to join Abercrombie, who complains
that he had not been told of that river; but if they were
afraid of being drowned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la nage</i>, 500 of them might have gone
into the river, and by holding themselves and their horses in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
proper direction might have formed a temporary bridge for the
other 500.</p>

<p>The flight failed through the King's departure a day later
than he proposed. The attendance of a democratic woman on
the Dauphin was to end on the day which had been fixed. The
King had announced to Bouillè that it would be better to delay
till the woman's time was out, but too late for him to give notice
to the Person and Troops he had posted. Charles Damas and
Choiseul<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> had advanced to meet the King. He not coming on the
day he was expected, they supposed the enterprise had failed, and
retired two hours only before the King arrived. He expected to
find a relay of horses on the Paris side of Varrennes. The horses
were waiting on the other side, of which the King had no information.
The Postillions would not pass the stage. The King,
not meeting those persons he expected, despaired. The Queen
was impatient, got out of the carriage, enquired at different places
for the relay. Thence suspicions arose. Damas and Choiseul
finding they had caused some jealousy, had returned by a cross
road, otherwise the King would have overtaken them. They
came into Varrennes after the King was seized. Bouillè says the
flight was entirely planned by the King, that the Emperor had
pressed the attempt. He excuses his letter, &amp;c., by saying "His
object was to turn the thoughts of the people from the King
on him." What a reverse for poor Bouillè! If the King had
reached Montmedi, I have not a doubt of his having been joined
by the Army and of his being now re-established at Paris.
Bouillè would have been in the highest situation. Now he is a
vagabond in Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HIDEOUS PLAGUE IN FRANCE.</div>

<p>Letters from Paris represent Pitt as the vilest Machiavel in
respect to French affairs. Perhaps France has no great right
to complain. When lately in London I dined in company with
the Duke of Richmond, and was sitting next him. I whispered
that the Princes were very well satisfied with our King's friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
letter to them, which promised neutrality on the part of Britain.
The Duke said, twice, with eagerness, "No, no. It promised
nothing." If the plague, comparatively a trifling misfortune,
had broke out in France, the neighbouring countries would have
formed a cordon round it&mdash;but now, when the most hideous
plague that can be imagined, rages there, which no cordon
ever will be able to contain, if it should continue, but which
inevitably will spread over and contaminate all Europe, it is
treated as a matter of ordinary policy. I do not understand
these precious Sovereigns. They deserve their fate, and their
ministers to be hanged, but I object to the several countries
being torn to pieces; at the same time I must say that I do not
see that there is sufficient ground to believe our ministers are
acting a double part as is supposed. Finally, it is obvious that
there is not at present the possibility of an arrangement between
the two parties of France, because neither party can govern or
answer for the multitude. Lally talks with much satisfaction of
the manner in which Lord Guilford expressed himself in respect
to Necker, his honour, honesty, &amp;c., &amp;c. He is greatly struck
with his candour, moderation and good sense. Remember me in an
handsome manner to M. and Madame Necker when you see them.</p>

<p>As you talk of being restored to your pristine tranquility
at Lausanne, and that Politicks are waved, I suppose Mr. Commissioner
Fischer is gone. Rather than part with him, I should
have been content with your alarms and your Politicks. I should
even have regretted the whiskers and my Friend Meluner. Maria
says the Commissioner is gone, because you presume to mention a
Ball. I hope Wilhelm de Severy was not obliged to make verses.
Remember us to his excellent Pere, Mere, &amp; S&oelig;ur.</p>

<p>Luckily it is not necessary to reserve much space for your
affairs. They are in good train. It is a satisfaction when I
can observe in you a dawning of intelligence in such matters,
and that you see there is an advantage of 15 per cent. in
changing at this time from the Funds to a Mortgage, besides
the security against depreciation. I have already written to
desire that your Fund in Yorkshire may be increased if it should
suit. I should have remembered the Dowager. However, the
interest of Stock now due and the money you have at Lausanne
will be enough for two months. Remember it will be
little more before considerable payments will be made. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
are a rich old fellow. I shall leave the India Bonds if the price
should be bad. The Lawyers' bills paid are only those I showed
to you. I apprehend the Madeira has begun its travels. I think
I discovered when I saw Lord Auckland lately, that he had
done nothing respecting the claret, but I believe I can provide
for you by another channel.</p>

<p>I have an imperfect recollection of having mentioned in a late
letter some instances of British prosperity, but I know not what.
The gross produce of the permanent Revenue of the year ending
5<sup>th</sup> Jan<sup>y</sup>, 1791, including Land-Tax and Annual Malt, amounted
to £20,355,380, exclusive of casual revenue, such as seizures, fines,
taxes on Places &amp; Pensions, First fruits, &amp;c., amounting to
£125,476, and exclusive also of the profits of the Lottery. The
actual receipt of the Excise for the same year was</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>


<p>Expense of management, £505,014. But allowances, Exports,
Bounties, &amp;c., reduced the nett payment into the Exchequer to
£7,689,973; notwithstanding this ample amount, the net increase
of the excise for the year ending 5<sup>th</sup> Jan<sup>y</sup>, 1792, will not be less
than £1,200,000, of which £800,000 are old, and £400,000 are
new duties. The general expence of collecting all the Taxes is
£5 13<em>s.</em> 7<em>d.</em> per cent. I understand the expence of collecting the
Revenue in France previous to the Revolution was £11 17<em>s.</em> 0<em>d.</em>
per cent.</p>

<p>You recollect that we ought to have been ruined by the Independence
of America&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">selon tous les regles</i>, except mine and a few
others&mdash;yet since 1773, when the troubles in America began, the
export of British manufactures have gradually increased upwards
of four millions annually. British built commercial tonnage has
increased since that period 318,522 tons, which is more than three-fourths
of the whole Commercial tonnage of France. Thanks to
that illustrious writer the Lord Sheffield. The total of French
commercial tonnage is 426,121. Total of English, 1,527,240,
English coasting tonnage 3,711,135, French ditto 1,004,729.
There is more Foreign than French shipping employed in the
trade of France. When their silly and crazy patriots have ruined
their West India trade, they will have little occasion for sailors.
Such considerations are beneath such elevated minds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MASSA KING WILBERFORCE.</div>

<p>We are going to send 300 dismounted Light Dragoons to
Jamaica and 600 foot from Nova Scotia. Hitherto all has been
quiet there, but 3000 Negroes assembled in the parish of Westmoreland
to celebrate Massa King Wilberforce's Birthday,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> lately
raised some alarm. Happily they were quietly dispersed. Have
you observed that the estimated expence of France for the last
year was about 26 millions sterling, and the Ways and Means about
24 millions? (It is rather awkward to set out with a deficit of 2
millions.) On the 31st October last, only about 2,700,000 had
been received, and it was not even supposed then that more than
2,400,000 more would be paid before the end of the year. The
Arrear of Taxes since the Revolution is about 70,000,000. The
Land-tax however is not to be considered as all lost. The imperfect
receipt of it arises from an incomplete arrangement, I
understand, as to the mode of collection. About 12 millions of
that tax are behind.</p>

<p>I have not thought so bad of your taste, since I heard the vile
unmeaning masses are removed from your Terrace, and I hope
most of the vulgar flower-pots. You have not given a tolerable
reason for preferring a bed-chamber which cannot have a good
approach, without indeed a very great expence. What I propose,
may be done without spoiling your Library, and without disturbing
you in that comfortable room.</p>

<p>I have not forgot your poultry, I could have done the needfull
for £7, instead of £70. You did not want a menagerie. The
alteration of the staircase would do away the most awkward
entrance I ever saw into an House at a very small expense&mdash;but
if the French Revolution is not checked, I must flatter myself
your Books will be used for cartridges. As to the letters, I
thought you expressed indifference about them before I left you.
I shall examine, altho' I do not believe there are many except of
a late Times. Assure the Duchess of Biron<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> (she is a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, April 4th, 1792.
</p>

<p>*For fear you should abuse me, as usual, I will begin the
attack, and scold at you, for not having yet sent me the long-expected
intelligence of the completion of my mortgage. You
had positively assured me that the second of February would
terminate my worldly cares, by a consummation so devoutly to
be wished. The news, therefore, might reach me about the
16th; and I argued with the gentle logic of lazyness, that it
was perfectly idle to answer your letter, till I could chaunt a
thanksgiving song of gratitude and praise. As every post disappointed
my hopes, the same argument was repeated for the
next; and twenty empty-handed postilions have blown their
insignificant horns, till I am provoked at last to write by sheer
impatience and vexation.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Facit indignatio versum. Cospetto di Baccho</i>; for I must ease
myself by swearing a little. What is the cause, the meaning, the
pretence, of this delay? Are the Yorkshire Mortgagors inconstant
in their wishes? are the London lawyers constant in their
procrastination? Is a letter on the road, to inform that all is concluded,
or to tell me that all is broke to pieces? In sober truth
I am out of humour to think of all the dinners that the Goslings
have given at my expence. Had the money been placed in the
three per Cents last May, besides the annual interest, it would
now have gained by the rise of stock nearly twenty per Cent.
Your Lordship is a wise man, a successful writer, and a useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Senator; you understand America and Ireland, Corn and Slaves,
but your prejudice against the funds, in which I am often tempted
to joyn, makes you a little blind to their encreasing value in the
hands of our virtuous and excellent minister. But our regret is
vain; one pull more and we reach the shore; and our future correspondence
will be no longer tainted with business. But shall I
then be more diligent and regular? I hope and believe so; for
now that I have got over this article of worldly interest, my letter
seems to be almost finished.</p>

<p>A propos of letters, am I not a sad dog to forget My Lady and
Maria? Alas! the dual number has been prejudicial to both.
How happy could I be with either, were t'other dear charmer
away. I am like the Ass of famous memory; I cannot tell which
way to turn first, and there I stand mute and immoveable. The
Baronial and maternal dignity of My Lady, supported by twenty
years' friendship, may claim the preference. But the five incomparable
letters of Maria!&mdash;Next week, however.&mdash;Am I not
ashamed to talk of next Week?</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MONTH WITH THE NECKERS.</div>

<p>I have most successfully, and most agreeably, executed my
plan of spending the month of March at Geneva, in the Necker
house, and every circumstance that I had arranged turned out
beyond my expectation; the freedom of the morning, the society
of the table and drawing-room, from half an hour past two till
six or seven; an evening assembly and card-party, in a round of
the best company, and, except one day in the week, a private
supper of free and friendly conversation. You would like Geneva
better than Lausanne; there is much more information to be got
among the men; but though I found some agreeable women,
their manners and style of life are, upon the whole, less easy and
pleasant than our own. I was much pleased with Necker's
brother, Mr. de Germani,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> a good-humoured, polite, sensible man,
without the genius or fame of the statesman, but much more
adapted for private and ordinary happiness.</p>

<p>Madame de Stael is expected in a few weeks at Copet, where
they receive her, and where, "to dumb forgetfullness a prey," she
will have leisure to regret the pleasing anxious being, which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
enjoyed amidst the storms of Paris. But what can the poor creature
do? her husband is in Sweden,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> her lover is no longer Secretary of
War,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and her father's house is the only place where she can reside
with the least degree of prudence and decency. Of that father I
have really a much higher idea than I ever had before; in our
domestic intimacy he cast away his gloom and reserve; I saw a
great deal of his mind, and all that I saw is fair and worthy. He
was overwhelmed by the hurricane, he mistook his way in the
fog, but in such a perilous situation, I much doubt whether any
mortal could have seen or stood. In the meanwhile, he is abused
by all parties, and none of the French in Geneva will set their
foot in his house. He remembers Lord Sheffield with esteem.
His health is good, and he would be tranquil in his private life,
were not his spirits continually wounded by the arrival of every
letter and every newspaper. His sympathy is deeply interested
by the fatal consequences of a Revolution, in which he had acted
so leading a part; and he feels as a friend for the danger of Mr.
de Lessart,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> who may be guilty in the eyes of the Jacobins, or
even of his judges, by those very actions and dispatches which
would be the most approved by all true Lovers of his Country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARCH OF THE MARSEILLAIS.</div>

<p>What a momentous event is the Emperor's death!<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> In the
forms of a new reign, and of the Imperial election, the Democrates
have at least gained time, if they knew how to use it. But the new
Monarch, though of a weak complexion, is of a martial temper;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
he loves the Soldiers, and is beloved by them; and the slow,
fluctuating politics of his uncle may be succeeded by a direct line
of march to the gates of Strasburgh and Paris. It is the opinion
of the master-movers in France, (I know it most certainly,) that
their troops will not fight, that the people have lost all sense of
patriotism, and that on the first discharge of an Austrian cannon
the game is up. But what occasion for Austrians or Spaniards?
the French are themselves their greatest enemies; 4000 Marseillais
are marched against Arles and Avignon, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">troupes de ligne</i> are
divided between the two parties, and the flame of civil war will
soon extend over the southern provinces.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> You have heard of
the unworthy treatment of the Swiss regiment of Ernst. The
canton of Bern has bravely recalled them, with a stout letter to
the King of France, which must be inserted in all the papers.</p>

<p>I now come to the most unpleasant articles, our home politics.
Rosset and La Motte are condemned to five and twenty years
imprisonment in the fortress of Arbourg. We have not yet
received their official sentence, nor is it believed that the proofs
and proceedings against them will be published; an awkward
circumstance, which it does not seem easy to justify. Some
(though none of note) are taken up, several are fled, many more
are suspected and suspicious. All are silent, but it is the silence
of fear and discontent; and the secret hatred which rankled
against Government begins to point against the few who are
known to be well-affected.</p>

<p>I never knew any place so much changed as Lausanne, even
since last year; and though you will not be much obliged to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
for the motive, I begin very seriously to think of visiting Sheffield-place
by the month of September next. Yet here again I am
frightened, by the dangers of a French, and the difficulties of a
German, route. You must send me an account of the passage
from Brighton, with an itinerary of the Rhine, distances, expences,
&amp;c. As usual, I just save the post, nor have I time to read my
letter, which, after wasting the morning in deliberation, has been
struck off in a heat since dinner. No news of the Madeira. The
views of Sh.-pl. are just received; they are admired, and shall be
framed. Severy has spent the Carnival at Turin. Trevor is
only the best man in the World.*</p>

<p>You will readily guess that I do not write to you because the

<p>When the Yorkshire business is finished you will have £20,000

<p>I am engaged in numberless matters before the Commons,

<p class="head">
Downing Street, 14 May, 1792.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ASYLUM AT BERNE.</div>

<p>The Plot thickens. Some information induces me to think
that Switzerland, till lately the happy and peaceful, may be disquieted,
especially the countries bordering on France. I can
conceive it possible that the insane discontents of the Pais de
Vaud may render Lausanne not altogether an eligible and
comfortable residence to you. We hear that the National Guards
have assembled on the borders towards Geneva and are trying to
perform some man&oelig;uvres. I can suppose it reasonable for you
to think of this Isle sooner than you intended,&mdash;that the border
may be disquieted and travelling for such an unweildy creature
neither commodious nor delightful. It is possible the Borders
may be less tempting for Travellers at present than some time
hence. In such case, if anything like turbulence should exist at
Lausanne, Berne may afford you the best Asylum till the journey
to old England may be safe and sure, that is void of embarrassments
which might annoy you, altho' they might appear
only curious events and agreeable Episodes to me and some others.
I apprehend that a journey by Germany, unless you make a great
detour, would be troublesome.</p>

<p>When we joked last Autumn about whiskers and Jacobins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and the great utility of books for making cartridges, I did not
think you so near disturbance as you possibly may be. The
annihilation of your books might be a proper judgement upon
you for the damned, parson-minded, inglorious idea of leaving
books to be sold. A trumpery fellow, that after having made a
good collection had not the idea of keeping them together by
leaving them to Sheffield Place, where they would involve the
books already there, and the whole be handed down <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seris nepotibus</i>
as the Gibbonian Library! I could hardly contain my indignation
when you mentioned your sniverling notion. I have often
fully and duly anathematized you since, but I do not flatter
myself that barbarism is as yet arrived at the trouble of attacking
the Library of an Aristocrate.</p>

<p>You will discover that I want to hear of you. At such a time
a few lines might have been expected even from you&mdash;or anything
ten times worse than you. How are the De Severy's? I should
have attempted to make amends for my Lady's neglect of writing,
if I had not been bothered in the extreme. I wish also to write to
Levade. Is Mrs. Moss arrived? Altho' the new French art of
War tends to enable to fight another day, yet it is to be hoped
the execrable troops will not take that trouble. After I left you
and had seen those warriors in Alsace, &amp;c., I transmitted my
opinion that they would take the very first opportunity of running
away and murdering their officers. Our Associations here
have now received a good brush. Your idea of signing Declarations
would be adopted by many, if there was not an apprehension
that Democrates would represent it as an Aristocrate
Association against the People. Your Yorkshire Mortgage draws
towards a conclusion. I have had an excellent letter of many
pages from Lally at Paris which I must forthwith answer.</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, May 30th, 1792.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p>*After the receipt of your <em>penultimate</em>, eight days ago, I
expected with much impatience, the arrival of your next-promised
Epistle. It arrived this morning, but has not compleatly
answered my expectations. I wanted, and I hoped for a full and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
fair picture of the present and probable aspect of your political
World, with which, at this distance, I seem every day less satisfied.
In the slave question you triumphed last session; in this you have
been defeated. What is the cause of this alteration? If it proceeded
only from an impulse of humanity, I cannot be displeased,
even with an error; since it is very likely that my own vote (had
I possessed one) would have been added to the Majority. But in
this rage against slavery, in the numerous petitions against the
Slave trade, was there no leaven of new democratical principles?
no wild ideas of the rights and natural equality of man? It is
these I fear. Some articles in newspapers, some pamphlets of the
year, the Jockey Club,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>&mdash;have fallen into my hands. I do not
infer much from such publications; yet I have never known
them of so black and malignant a cast. I shuddered at Grey's
motion,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> disliked the half-support of Fox, admired the firmness of
Pitt's declaration, and excused the usual intemperance of Burke.
Surely such men as* Grey, Sheridan, Erskine, *have talents for
mischief.</p>

<p>I see a Club of reform<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> which contains some respectable
names. Inform me of the professions, the principles, the plans,
the resources of these reformers. Will they heat the minds
of the people? Does the French democracy gain no ground?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Will the bulk of your party stand firm to their own interest, and
that of their country? Will you not take some active measures
to declare your sound opinions, and separate yourselves from your
rotten members? or if you allow them to perplex government, if
you trifle with this solemn business, if you do not resist the spirit
of innovation in the first attempt, if you admit the smallest
and most specious change in our parliamentary system, you
are lost. You will be driven from one step to another; from
principles just in theory, to consequences most pernicious in
practice; and your first concessions will be productive of every
subsequent mischief, for which you will be answerable to
your country and to posterity. Do not suffer yourselves to be
lulled into a false security; remember the proud fabric of the
French Monarchy. Not four years ago it stood founded, as it
might seem, on the rock of time, force, and opinion, supported by
the triple Aristocracy of the Church, the Nobility, and the Parliaments.
They are crumbled into dust; they are vanished from
the earth. If this tremendous warning has no effect on the men
of property in England; if it does not open every eye, and raise
every arm, you will deserve your fate. If I am too precipitate,
enlighten; if I am too desponding, encourage me.</p>

<p>My pen has run into this argument; for, as much a foreigner
as you think me, on this momentous subject I feel myself an
Englishman.</p>

<p>The pleasure of residing at Sheffield-place is, after all, the first
and the ultimate object of my visit to my native country. But
when or how will that visit be effected? Clouds and whirlwinds,
Austrian Croats, and Gallic cannibals, seem on every side to
impede my passage. You appear to apprehend the perils or
difficulties of the German road, and French peace is more sanguinary
than civilized War. I must pass through, perhaps, a
thousand Republics or municipalities, which neither obey nor are
obeyed. The strictness of passports, and the popular ferment, are
much encreased since last summer: Aristocrate is in every mouth,
Lanterns hang in every street, and an hasty word or a casual
resemblance, may be fatal. Yet, on the other hand, it is probable
that many English, men, women, and children, will traverse the
country without any accident before next September; and I am
sensible that many things appear more formidable at a distance
than on a nearer approach. Without any absolute determination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
we must see what the events of the next three or four months
will produce. In the mean while, I shall expect with impatience
your next letter: let it be speedy; my answer shall be prompt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GALLIC WOLVES PROWL ROUND GENEVA.</div>

<p>You will be glad, or sorry, to learn that my gloomy apprehensions
are much abated, and that my departure, whenever it
takes place, will be an act of choice, rather than of necessity. I
do not pretend to affirm, that secret discontent, dark suspicion,
private animosity, are very materially asswaged; but we have
not experienced, nor do we now apprehend, any dangerous acts
of violence, which may compell me to seek a refuge among the
friendly Bears,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and to abandon my library to the mercy of the
Democrates. The firmness and vigour of Government have
crushed, at least for a time, the spirit of innovation; and I do
not believe that the body of the people, especially the Peasants, are
disposed for a revolution. From France, praised be the Demon
of Anarchy! the insurgents of the pays de Vaud could not at
present have much to hope; and should the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gardes nationales</i>, of
which there is little appearance, attempt an incursion, the country
is armed and prepared, and they would be resisted with equal
numbers and superior discipline. The Gallic wolves that prowled
round Geneva are drawn away, some to the south and some to the
north, and the late events in Flanders seem to have diffused a
general contempt, as well as abhorrence, for the lawless savages,
who fly before the enemy, hang their prisoners, and murder their
officers.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The brave and patient regiment of Ernest is expected
home every day, and as Bern will take them into present pay, that
veteran and regular corps will add to the security of our frontier.</p>

<p>I rejoyce that we have so little to say on that subject of
Worldly affairs.* Since the interest of the Yorkshire is due from
the mouth of February my complaints are silenced, but I am
desirous of the consummation of the business. You seem to
applaud your good fortune in finding an excellent settlement for
£3000, with which you have purchased three unexceptionable
Debentures, but you forget to mention who are my Creditors and
in what part of the Globe my landed security is placed. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
confess some fears of Ireland or the West Indies, with neither of
which I would willingly have any connection. As my property is
now divided, I should much wish that you would draw up and
sign a regular statement of the several objects, stating in whose
hands and where the respective title deeds are deposited. With
regard to those which are entrusted &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> it could not surely be
offensive to ask him for a written acknowledgment. I have no
evidence whatsoever to produce to his Executors; this thought
sometimes makes me rather uneasy. I thank you for the offer
of supporting my Credit at Gosling's; but the stream now begins
to flow faster than I draw, and they have been instructed to keep
£500 India bonds from your talons. Notwithstanding the
Darrel's caution, I wish you had seized the propitious moment
when stocks were so ridiculously high. I am much surprized to
have no account whatsoever of the approach of my Madeira,
which has been so injudiciously paid for beforehand; enquiries
must be made. Will you likewise inform yourself of the Wedgewood,
why I have not been able to obtain their old account
which was solicited by letter, a strong measure from me, when I
paid Severy's bill two or three years ago? If they have waited
scandalously for their money, it is not my fault; but I do not
like it myself, as it is the only debt I have in the World.
Mrs. Moss saw my house and garden in a rainy day, and her
passage was so rapid that I could not even give her a dish of tea:
she seems pleased with her situation at Geneva.</p>

<p>*This summer we are threatened with an inundation, besides
many nameless English and Irish; the Dowager Lady Spencer
is arrived, the Dutchess of Ancaster is expected, but I am less
anxious about those matrons, than for the good Dutchess of
Devonshire and the wicked Lady Elizabeth Foster, who are on
their march. Lord Malmsbury, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">audacieux</i> Harris,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> will inform
you that he has seen me: <em>him</em> I would have consented to keep.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DESTINY OF HIS LIBRARY.</div>

<p>Before I absolutely conclude, I must animadvert on the
whimsical peroration of your last Epistle concerning the future
fate of my library,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> about which you are so indignant. I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
friend to the circulation of property of every kind, and besides the
pecuniary advantage of my poor heirs, I consider a public sale as
the most laudable method of disposing of it. From such sales
my books were chiefly collected, and when I can no longer use
them they will be again culled by various buyers according to the
measure of their wants and means. If indeed a true liberal public
library existed in London, I might be tempted to enrich the catalogue
and encourage the institution: but to bury my treasure in
a <em>country</em> mansion under the key of a jealous master! I am not
flattered by the Gibbonian collection, and shall own my presumptuous
belief that six quarto Volumes may be sufficient for
the preservation of that name. If however your unknown successor
should be a man of learning, if I should live to see the love
of litterature dawning in your grandson&mdash;&mdash; In the meanwhile I
admire the firm confidence of our friendship that you can insist,
and I can demur, on a legacy of fifteen hundred or two thousand
pounds without the smallest fear of offence.</p>

<p>*One word more before we part; call upon Mr. John Nichols,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
bookseller and printer, at Cicero's head, Red-Lion-passage, Fleet-street,
and ask him whether he did not, about the beginning of
March, receive a very polite letter<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> from Mr. Gibbon of Lausanne?
To which, either as a man of business or a civil Gentleman, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
should have returned an answer. My application related to a
domestic article in the Gentleman's magazine of August, 1788,
(p. 698,)<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> which had lately fallen into my hands, and concerning
which I requested some farther lights. Mrs. Moss delivered the
letters into my hands, but I doubt whether they will be of much
service to me; the work appears far more difficult in the execution
than in the idea, and as I am now taking my leave for some time
of the library, I shall not make much progress in the memoirs of
P. P. till I am on English ground. But is it indeed true, that I
shall eat any Sussex pheasants this autumn? The event is in the
book of Fate, and I cannot unroll the leaves of September and
October. Should I reach Sheffield-place, I hope to find the whole
family in a perfect state of existence, except a certain Maria
Holroyd, my fair and <em>generous</em> correspondent, whose annihilation
on proper terms I most fervently desire. I must receive a copious
answer before the end of next month, June, and again call upon
you for a map of your political World. The Chancellor roars;
does he break his chain? <em>Vale.</em>*</p>

<p>Your former letter said you should be very sure, very high
&amp; select. You now say you are not merchants, &amp;c. General
Bude<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> (a Genevois) recommended Dergueuse. The Duke of
Leeds, hearing that he was known to me, desired Glover to
enquire of me by letter. I advised Leigneur not to propose or
trouble himself about terms, but to let General Bude do whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
was necessary of that kind. He has been at Moins sometime.
He came from thence here, and is much pleased with his good
fortune. Lord Carnarvon is older than we imagined. If there
are the means at Lausanne of interesting Genl. Bude in favour
of S[every], it might be usefull. I should make an agreement
for S. or not according to the rank or character of the Principles;
but I really do not know what salary should be thought of&mdash;you
should give me some hint thereon. When I answered Glover, I
told him if he should hear of any considerable Family who wished
to have a friend to attend a son, that you and I could recommend
one that would be very desireable. You are so awkward and
careless about letters that I do not like to write to you except
about matters that might be published at Charing-cross.</p>

<p>As to your £3000 debentures, I apprehend I have explained
them to you before. Hammersley's Banking House has advanced
£40,000 on Lord Barrymore's Estate in Ireland (£10,000 per
annum at least); they have 6 per cent., and have raised the
money by Debentures, giving the same security and £20,000 in
the funds in addition. Their house and the £20,000 answerable
for the interest. It is thought an <em>excellent thing</em>, and Pelham
transferred it to me as a Friend. If you do not like it at any
time you may have premium on selling. I wish you to indulge
your own notions as to this matter and not to mind mine. I am
not fond of being responsible as to other property than land.
The Debentures are in the custody of Goslings, to enable them to
receive at Hammersley's the interest half yearly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIBBON'S TABBY APPREHENSIONS.</div>

<p>Your Tabby apprehensions about your writings are silly enough&mdash;you
have none except the mortgage on Buriton and Newhaven,
and those being blended in your conveyance of the Estates, the
Title of the purchaser and your security are the same, and if your
counterpart were lost, the Title of the Purchaser would be your
security. The Mortgage Deeds of Buriton are in my archive, very
properly as Trustee. Instead of your curious notion of sending
the writings in Batt's custody for the sake of safety to Lausanne,
it will be better to send them in their Box to Gosling's Iron-room,
to appease your fears. I had settled with Batt to examine the
List when I go next to Town. Your Navigation Mortgage is in
Gosling's hands. I had lately heard of a £3000 mortgage in
this county that I thought would do, but they talked of only 3&frac12;
per Ct.</p>

<p>I have had a new care lately which has occupied me as much
as possible. I mean the French clergy; above 1200 have landed
in this country. I have exerted myself in their favour; I have
succeeded pretty well in obviating prejudice in respect to the rise
of provisions by the arrival of so many friends. There is little
in respect to the arrival of so many popish priests.</p>

<p>Tell Lady Eliza I have written a very pretty letter long ago,

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>591.</h2>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 30 July, 1792.
</p>

<p>If I had not been bothered in a superlative degree since my
return from London with much company, Navigation and County
Meetings, &amp;c., I should have favoured you with my opinion on
the state of things. Twice each week I intended so to do at
some length, and now I begin just before I set out for the Camp
at Bagshot.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>I have watched the origin, impression and progress of the
French Revolution, both in France and in the other Governments
in Europe, and I am fully convinced that if our Good Old Island
had been drawn into the torrent of the new Philosophy, Holland,
Germany, Spain, &amp;c., would have followed her, and we should
have seen all Europe involved in the extravagances of irreligion,
immorality, anarchy, and barbarism. Our nature being at all
times essentially the same, I presume that after a certain period
of ferociousness and horrors, a resettlement of some sort, probably
of the most despotic governments, would have taken place. The
devastation of the Species might be repaired, and at the end of a
couple of centuries it is possible that Science, the fine Arts, and
the politeness and gentleness of Society, might again have been
brought to the point at which they now are. Perhaps you may
recollect that on the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire a
greater number of centuries were necessary for restoration. I
really believe there is nothing exaggerated in this speculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION AND GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>Having these opinions, I highly approved and cordially promoted
the conduct of Opposition at such a crisis. They have come
to the Aid of Government fairly and unreservedly, and many, even
zealously, particularly the Dukes of Portland, Devonshire, Lord
Fitzwilliam, Guilford, Spencer, Egremont, Ashburnham, Stormont,
Loughborough, Windham of Norfolk, Sir Gilbert Elliott, in short
almost everybody except about a score who had committed themselves
with Mr. Grey, many of whom are heartily sick of the
business.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The attempt at an Association has in truth had an
excellent effect. It has alarmed, roused and combined men in
support of the Constitution and of good order. It will at last
appear that there exists no great object or principle of party
difference. It may lead to the formation of the strongest administration
this country has ever known, and at a time when
there should be no risk. It should be the first of all objects in
these feverish times to guard against all possibility of phrenzy.
At present there is very little amiss among men of property.
The Dissenters however wait a good occasion for some change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
The great care should be to prevent the mass of the people from
being inflamed and made the tools of those who would risk anything
to gain certain points or situations. It is essential to
engage, to occupy the best of those.</p>

<p>There never was such an opportunity as at present of forming
a good administration. Several openings can be easily made in
the Cabinet and elsewhere without essential derangement. Lord
Thurlow is gone,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Lord Campden wishes to go, Marquis of Stafford
is willing to go, and Dundas is only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum tenens</i>.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The concurrence
in favour of the Constitution has greatly softened the
asperity of party. I never observed so great a change, and I am
convinced a junction would be generally liked by the respectable
men of all parties and descriptions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAN PITT AND FOX COMBINE?</div>

<p>There is a difficulty and that is great. Whether insurmountable
I cannot say. How to arrange Pompey and Caesar&mdash;Pitt
and Fox. Government has candidly said it is not strong
enough, the candour of the avowal has tended rather to conciliate
than to animate opposition. Lord Loughborough has
had a conversation with Pitt and Dundas.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> I scout the idea of
the Party coming in without Fox. He has behaved, at all times,
honourably to them and they will behave honourably towards
him. Even if they were capable of quitting him, it would be
foolish to leave him to bear the discontent of the country.
Neither Fox nor Pitt should be suffered to be in that situation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Even if the King were to send for the Duke of Portland and
desire him to form an administration, the best answer would be
that he could not, without Mr. Pitt, form one which would be
sufficiently firm and strong enough to carry on business as it
should be, especially at this time. Both parties are too strong
to suffer Government to go on efficaciously without them: but
how to arrange Fox &amp; Pitt, so that one should not seem to yield
too much to the other, there is the rub. I should think it the
most patriotick act to settle that matter. I discover no animosity,
no rancour, no interest likely to make the parties disagree if
once united, nothing that would dispose them to circumvent. I
think it the interest of both our Orators to unite. I never
supposed I should find it the wish of so many of the first men
of the Country as I do. It appears to me to be greatly Pitt's
interest. The regret of both King and Queen on the dismission
of the Chancellor is well known. If Pitt should make an
handsome fair offer to Fox (I do not know the latter is averse)
and he should refuse, especially after the late business of Grey,
it will prejudice Fox much with his party. If, on the other
hand, Pitt should directly or indirectly aim at excluding him, the
overture that has been made and the evident want of strength
in Government would exasperate some, and encourage others to
a redoubled spirit of opposition. Pitt must see that, if such an
administration could be formed, there would be scarce a great
family in opposition, and that distinction of party in that administration
would soon be lost. Although the business is
difficult I do not think it impossible. It is rather suspended
than broke off. I should have supposed the Duke of Richmond
most likely of all to be averse to it, but I find him much disposed
to a junction.</p>

<p>Maria amuses herself very much with my conciliating and
amiable moderation, but you will discover that my present disposition
is perfectly consistent with the opinion I always had of
the advantage to the Country at all times, and the necessity in
these times, of a firm and strong Government.</p>

<p>I have now inflicted on you and myself a large <em>dose</em>.</p>

<p>Give us intelligence of you forthwith. When you set out.
Which road you take. The French subject is too much to begin
on. The Jacobins are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au comble</i>. Such execrable animals should
be extirpated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Pray acquaint Lady Elizabeth that I have this moment rec<sup>d</sup>.
her letter, that we wished it had been longer, and that I shall
endeavour to collect something for her amusement very speedily.
Present my best compliments also to the Duchess.</p>

<p class="head">
Lausanne, August 1st, 1792.
</p>

<p class="open">
<span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the arts of our great Enemy, the
Demon of procrastination, I should not have postponed for so
many months a pleasing duty, which may at any time be performed
in a single hour, had I not for some time past entertained
a lively and probable hope of visiting you this autumn in person;
had I not flattered myself, that the very next post I might be
able to fix the day of my departure from Lausanne, and almost
of my arrival at the Belvidere. That hope is now vanished, and
my journey to England is unavoidably delayed till the spring or
summer of next year. *The extraordinary state of public affairs
in France opposes an insuperable bar to my passage; and every
prudent stranger will avoid that inhospitable land, in which a
people of slaves is suddenly become a nation of tyrants and
cannibals. The German road is indeed safe, but, independent
of a great addition of fatigue and expence, the armies of Austria
and Prussia now cover that frontier; and though the Generals
are polite, and the troops well disciplined, I am not desirous of
passing through the Clouds of Hussars and Pandours that attend
their motions. These public reasons are fortified by some private
motives, and to this delay I resign myself with a sigh for the
present, and a hope for the future.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAINT OF DEMOCRATICAL INFECTION.</div>

<p>What a strange wild World do we live in! You will allow
me to be a tolerable historian, yet, on a fair review of ancient
and modern times, I can find none that bear any affinity with
the present. My knowledge of your discerning mind, and my
recollection of your political principles, assure me, that you are
no more a <em>Democrat</em> than myself. Had the French improved
their glorious opportunity to erect a free constitutional Monarchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
on the ruins of arbitrary power and the Bastile, I should applaud
their generous effort; but this total subversion of all rank, order,
and government, could be productive only of a popular monster,
which after devouring every thing else, must finally devour itself.
I was once apprehensive that this monster would propagate some
imps in our happy island, but they seem to have been crushed in
the cradle; and I acknowledge with pleasure and pride the good
sense of the English nation, who seem truly conscious of the
blessings which they enjoy: and I am happy to find that the
most respectable part of opposition has cordially joyned in
the support of "things as they are." Even this country has
been somewhat tainted with the Democratical infection: the
vigilance of Government has been exerted, the malecontents have
been awed, the misguided have been undeceived, the feaver in
the blood has gradually subsided, and I flatter myself that we
have secured the tranquil enjoyment of obscure felicity, which
we had been almost tempted to despise.</p>

<p>You have heard, most probably, from Mrs. Holroyd, of the
long-expected though transient satisfaction which I received from
the visit of the Sheffield family. He appeared highly satisfied
with my arrangements here, my house, garden, and situation, at
once in town and country, which are indeed singular in their
kind, and which have often made me regret the impossibility of
showing them to my dearest friend of the Belvidere. Lord S.
is still, and will ever continue, the same active being, always
employed for himself, his friends, and the public, and always
persuading himself that he wishes for leisure and repose.* He has
now a new care on his hands, the management and disposal of
his eldest daughter, who is indeed a most extraordinary young
woman. *There are various roads to happiness; but when I
compare his situation with mine, I do not, upon the whole,
repent that I have given the preference to a life of celibacy and
retirement. Although I have been long a spectator of the great
World, my unambitious temper has been content with the occupations
and rewards of study; and although my library be still my
favourite room, I am now no longer stimulated by the prosecution
of any litterary work. The society of Lausanne is adapted
to my taste; my house is open to many agreeable acquaintance,
and some real friends; the uniformity of the natives is enlivened
by travellers of all nations; and this summer I am happy in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
familiar intercourse with Lady Spencer, the Dutchess of Devonshire,
Lady Elizabeth Foster, and Lady Duncannon, who seems
to be gradually recovering from her dreadful complaints. My
health is remarkably good. I have now enjoyed a long interval
from the gout; and I endeavour to use with moderation Dr.
Cadogan's best remedies, temperance, exercise, and cheerfulness.
Adieu, Dear Madam; may every blessing that Nature can allow
be attendant on your latter season! Your age and my habits
will not permit a very close correspondence; but I wish to hear,
and I <em>presume</em> to ask, a speedy <em>direct</em> account of your own situation.
May it be such as I shall hear with pleasure! Once more
Adieu; I live in hopes of embracing you next summer at the
Belvidere, but you may be assured that I bring over nothing for
the press.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, August 23rd, 1792.
</p>

<p>*When I inform you that the design of my English expedition
is at last postponed to another year, you will not be much surprized.
The public obstacles, the danger of one road, and the
difficulties of another, would alone be sufficient to arrest so unwieldy
and inactive a Being; and these obstacles on the side of
France, are growing every day more insuperable. On the other
hand, the terrors, which might have driven me from hence, have
in a great measure, subsided; our state prisoners are forgot; the
country begins to recover its old good humour and unsuspecting
confidence, and the last revolution of Paris appears to have convinced
almost every body of the fatal consequences of Democratical
principles, which lead by a path of flowers into the Abyss
of Hell. I may therefore wait with patience and tranquillity till
the Duke of Brunswick shall have opened the French road. But
if I am not driven from Lausanne, you will ask, I hope with some
indignation, whether I am not drawn to England, and more
especially to Sheffield-place? The desire of embracing you and
yours is now the strongest, and must gradually become the sole,
inducement that can force me from my library and garden, over
seas and mountains. The English World will forget and be
forgotten, and every year will deprive me of some acquaintance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
who by courtesy are styled friends: Lord Guilford<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and Sir Joshua

whom I the most relied for the comforts of society.*</p>

<p>Even the satisfaction which I promised myself at Sheffield
would at present be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRUNSWICK MARCHES ON PARIS.</div>

<p>*Thus far had I written in the full confidence of finishing and
sending my letter the next post; but six post-days have unaccountably
slipped away, and were you not accustomed to my silence, you
would almost begin to think me on the road. How dreadfully,
since my last date, has the French road been polluted with blood!
and what horrid scenes may be acting at this moment, and may still
be aggravated, till the Duke of Brunswick<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> is master of Paris! On
every rational principle of calculation he must succeed; yet sometimes,
when my spirits are low, I dread the blind efforts of mad
and desperate multitudes fighting on their own ground. A few
days or weeks must decide the military operations of this year, and
perhaps for ever; but on the fairest supposition, I cannot look
forwards to any firm settlement, either of a legal or an absolute
government. I cannot pretend to give you any Paris news.
Should I inform you, as we believe, that <em>Lally</em><a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> <em>is still among the
cannibals</em>, you would possibly answer, that he is now sitting in
the library at Sheffield. Madame de Stael,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> after miraculously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
escaping through pikes and poniards, has reached the castle of
Copet, where I shall see her before the end of the week. If any
thing can provoke the King of Sardinia and the Swiss, it must
be the foul destruction of <em>his</em> cousin Madame de Lamballe,
and of <em>their</em> regiment of guards.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> An extraordinary council is
summoned at Berne, <em>but resentment may be checked by prudence</em>.
In spite of Maria's laughter, I applaud your moderation, and sigh
for a hearty union of all the sense and property of the country.
The times require it; but your last political letter was a cordial
to my spirits. The Duchess of D. rather dislikes a coalition:
amiable creature! The Eliza (we call her Bess) is furious against
you for not writing. We shall lose them in a few days; but the
motions of Bess and the Duchess for Italy or England, are doubtful.
Ladies Spencer and Duncannon certainly pass the Alps. I
live with them.*</p>

<p>The interesting subjects of our late correspondence seem to
have obliterated all memory of my private concerns, which have
suffered as usual a rub when we thought them finally terminated.
Although my ideas about money matters are grown somewhat
confused, I do not believe there is much <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</i> left, and
have no doubt that the different channels of interest will be
properly filled at Michaelmas, but I should be glad to see the
greatest part of my decreasing short annuities well secured in a
mortgage, and I flatter myself that yourself and agents are alive
to that pursuit. But I must again put you in mind of two
interesting queries to which I have not yet received any answer.
1. What is the nature of the three thousand pounds debentures
which you purchased last Winter? Who is my debtor? and what
and where is my security? Surely this is no idle curiosity on my
side. 2. I wished to know in what hands the different deeds of
my property are vested, and to possess something like a written
attestation. The Buriton Mortgage and the aforesaid debentures
are very properly, as I suppose, in Lord Sheffield's iron chest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fort bien.</i> My short annuities in their own books and in Mr. E.
Darrel's&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas mal</i>; my Sussex Navigation and India Bonds with
Gosling, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passe encore</i>: but my claims on you, the Newhaven
Mortgage and the Annuity are delivered&mdash;are they not, to Mr.
Batt, an honourable but a sickly man? Should he fail, have we
any to exhibit to his unknown heir? If delicacy, false delicacy,
forbids your asking for a receipt, or taking them, which I should
like better, into your own custody, I must seriously desire they
may be sent over to me. Did I not express some anxiety on this
head, you would have a right to call me a very careless fellow.</p>

<p>There are some minor matters which you may find in my long
letter;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> such as a request to settle a shameful obsolete bill, my
only one, at Wedgwood's, and to enquire whether Mr. John
Nichols, bookseller in Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, did not
receive a letter from me last March which he has never answered.
But I must insist on a hogshead of Madeira announced, shipped,
and, I believe, paid six months ago, but which has never reached
my lips or my cellar. This must be explored. *Adieu. Since I
do not appear in person, I feel the absolute propriety of writing
to my lady and Maria; but there is far from the knowledge
to the performance of a duty.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVERY DAY MORE SEDENTARY.</div>

<p>As you must have been informed by Lord Sheffield
of my approaching arrival, I trust that you will feel some disappointment
when you are told by myself that my journey to
England is delayed to another year. The cause of this delay
proceeds solely from the troubles of the continent. It would be
madness to venture my life in the land of Cannibals, and the
circuitous route by Germany would be attended with a large
increase of trouble and expense. I grow every day more sedentary,
and could I have the pleasure of shewing you my house, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
library, and my garden, you would not be surprised that I should
quit them with some reluctance. You may perhaps be likewise
disappointed at hearing that I shall probably come empty-handed.
A variety of untoward circumstances have contributed to encrease
my indolence. I cannot please myself with the choice of a subject,
and it may be prudent to enjoy rather than expose my historical
fame.</p>

<p>Several months ago I wrote a very civil letter to <em>Mr. John.
Nichols, Bookseller at Cicero's head, Red Lion Passage, Fleet
Street</em>, which (had he received it) I can scarcely persuade myself he
would have left without an answer. It related to a very curious
paper about the Gibbon family inserted in the Gentleman's
Magazine, August, 1788, p. 698, which had just fallen into my
hands. I wished to know the author and by what means I could
correspond with him on the subject. Perhaps you may be able,
and I am sure you are willing, to clear up that point and put me
in a proper channel by a personal application either to the aforesaid
John Nichols or to some other person concerned in the
Gentleman's Magazine.</p>

<p>Be so kind as to inform Elmsley of what he will hardly believe,
that I am preparing materials for a letter to him, with a long list
of commissions. Among these I wish you boldly to introduce the
works of merit, history, travels, literature, philosophy, and even
extraordinary novels which bear your authentic stamp.</p>

<p>My best compliments to Mr. Strahan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH INVASION OF SAVOY.</div>

<p>*As our English newspapers must have informed you of the
invasion of Savoy<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> by the French, and as it is possible that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
may have some trifling apprehensions of my being killed and eaten
by those Cannibals, it has appeared to me that a short extraordinary
dispatch might not be unacceptable on this occasion. It is indeed
true, that about ten days ago the French army of the south, under
the command of Mr. de Montesquiou, (if any French army can be
said to be under any command,) has entered Savoy, and possessed
themselves of Chamberry, Montmelian, &amp; several other places. It
has always been the practise of the King of Sardinia to abandon
his transalpine dominions; but on this occasion the Court of Turin
appears to have been surprized by the strange eccentric motions of
a Democracy, which always acts from the passion of the moment;
and their inferior troops have retreated, with some loss and disgrace,
into the passes of the Alps. Mount Cenis is now impervious,
and our English travellers who are bound for Italy, the Dutchesses
of Devonshire, Ancaster, &amp;c., will be forced to explore a long
circuitous road through the Tirol. But the Chablais is yet intact,
nor can our telescopes discover the tricolor banners on the other
side of the lake. Our accounts of the French numbers seem to
vary from fifteen to thirty thousand men; the regulars are few,
but they are followed by a rabble rout, which must soon, however,
melt away, as they will find no plunder, and scanty subsistence, in
the poverty and barrenness of Savoy. N.B. I have just seen a
letter from M. de M., who boasts that at his first entrance into
Savoy he had only twelve battalions. Our intelligence is far from
correct.</p>

<p>The Magistrates of Geneva were alarmed by this dangerous
neighbourhood, and more especially by the well known animosity
of an exiled citizen, Claviere,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> who is one of the six ministers of
the French Republic. It was carried by a small Majority in the
general council, to call in the succour of three thousand Swiss,
which is stipulated by ancient treaty. The strongest reason or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
pretence of the minority, was founded on the danger of provoking
the French, and they seem to have been justified by the event;
since the complaint of the French resident amounts to a declaration
of War. The fortifications of Geneva are not contemptible,
especially on the side of Savoy; and it is much doubted whether
M. de Montesquiou is prepared for a regular siege; but the malcontents
are numerous within the walls, and I question whether
the spirit of the citizens would hold out against a bombardment.
In the meanwhile the diet has declared, that the first canon fired
against Geneva will be considered as an act of hostility against the
whole Helvetic body. Berne, as the nearest and most powerful
Canton, has taken the lead with great vigour and vigilance; the
road is filled with the perpetual succession of troops and artillery;
and, if some disaffection lurks in the towns, the peasants, especially
the Germans, are inflamed with a strong desire of encountering
the murderers of their Countrymen. Mr. de Watteville, with
whom you dined at my house last year, refused to accept the
command of the Swiss succour of Geneva, till it was made his first
instruction that he should never, in any case, surrender himself
prisoner of War.</p>

<p>In this situation, you may suppose that we have some fears.
I have great dependence, however, on the many chances in our
favour, the valour of the Swiss, the return of the Piedmontese
with their Austrian allies, 8 or 10 thousand men from the Milanese,
a diversion from Spain, the great events (how slowly they proceed)
on the side of Paris, the inconstancy and want of discipline of the
French, and the near approach of the winter season. I am not
nervous, but I will not be rash. It will be painful to abandon my
house and library; but if the danger should approach, I will
retreat before it, first to Bern, and gradually to the North. Should
I even be forced to take refuge in England (a violent measure so
late in the year) you would perhaps receive me as kindly as you
do the French priests&mdash;a noble act of hospitality! Could I have
foreseen this storm, I would have been there six months ago;
but who can foresee the wild measures of the Savages of Gaul?
We thought ourselves perfectly out of the Hurricane latitudes.
Adieu. I am going to bed, and must rise early to visit the Neckers
at Rolle, whither they have retired, from the frontier situation
of Copet. Severy is on horseback, with his dragoons: his poor
father is dangerously ill. It will be shocking if it should be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
necessary to remove him. While we are in this very awkward
crisis, I will write at least every week.</p>

<p class="signature">
Ever yours,<br />
E. G.
</p>

<p>Write instantly, and remember all my commissions.</p>

<p>I will keep my promise of sending you a weekly journal of our
troubles, that, when the piping times of peace are restored, I may
sleep in long and irreproachable silence; but I shall use a smaller
paper, as our military exploits will seldom be sufficient to fill the
ample size of an English quarto.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENEVA THREATENED.</div>

<p>*Since my last of the 6th, our attack is not more imminent,
and our defence is most assuredly stronger, two very important
circumstances, at a time when every day is leading us, though not
so fast as our impatience could wish, towards the unwarlike month
of November; and we observe with pleasure that the troops of
M. de Montesquiou, which are chiefly from the southern provinces,
will not chearfully entertain the rigour of an Alpine Winter.</p>

<p>The 7th instant, M. de Chateauneuf, the French resident,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> took
his leave with an haughty mandate, commanding the Genevois, as
they valued their safety and the friendship of the Republic, to
dismiss their Swiss allies, and to punish the Magistrates who had
traiterously proposed the calling in these foreign troops. It is
precisely the fable of the Wolves, who offered to make peace with
the sheep, provided they would send away their dogs. You know
what became of the sheep. This demand appears to have kindled
a just and generous indignation, since it announced an Edict of
proscription; and must lead to a Democratical revolution, which
would probably renew the horrid scenes of Paris and Avignon. A
General assembly of the Citizens was convened, the message was
read, speeches were made, oaths were taken, and it was resolved,
with only three dissentient votes, to live and dye in the defence
of their country. The Genevois muster above three thousand
well-armed citizens; and the Swiss, who may easily be encreased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in a few hours, to an equal number, add spirit to the timorous,
and confidence to the well-affected: their arsenals are filled with
arms, their magazines with ammunition, and their granaries with
corn. But their fortifications are extensive and imperfect, they
are commanded from two adjacent hills; a French faction lurks
in the City; the character of the Genevois is rather commercial
than military; and their behaviour, lofty promise, and base surrender,
in the year 1782,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> is fresh in our memories. In the meanwhile,
4000 French at the most are arrived in the neighbouring
camp, nor is there yet any appearance of mortars or heavy artillery.
Perhaps a haughty menace may be repelled by a firm countenance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIBBON PREPARED FOR FLIGHT.</div>

<p>If it were worth while talking of justice, what a shameful attack
of a feeble unoffending state! On the news of their danger, all
Switzerland, from Schaffouse to the Pays de Vaud, has risen in
arms; and a French resident, who has passed through the country,
in his way from Ratisbon, declares his intention of informing and
admonishing the National convention. About eleven thousand
Bernois are already posted in the neighbourhood of Copet and
Nyon; and new reinforcements of men, artillery, &amp;c., arrive every
day. Another army is drawn together to oppose Mr. de Ferrieres,
on the side of Bienne and the Bishoprick of Basle; and the
Austrians in Swabia would be easily persuaded to cross the Rhine
in our defence. But we are yet ignorant whether our sovereigns
mean to wage offensive or defensive War. If the latter, which is
more likely, will the French begin the attack? Should Geneva
yield to fear or force, this country is open to an invasion; and
though our men are brave, we want Generals; and I despise the
French much less than I did two months ago. It should seem*<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
from Trevor's letters, who is indeed low-spirited, *that our hopes
from the King of Sardinia and the Austrians of Milan are faint
and distant; Spain sleeps, and the Duke of Brunzwick (amazement!)
seems to have failed in his great project. For my part, till Geneva
falls, I do not think of a retreat; but, at all events, I am provided
with two strong horses, and a hundred Louis in gold. Zurich
would be probably my winter quarters, and the society of the
Neckers would make any place agreable. Their situation is worse
than mine: I have no daughter ready to lye in;<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> nor do I fear
the French aristocrates on the road.</p>

<p>Adieu. Keep my letters; excuse contradictions and repetitions.

Elizabeth abhorrs you.*</p>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 17th Oct., '92.
</p>

<p>I have not patience to talk with you on the state of things,
I am lamentably disappointed. De Custine's successful incursion<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
into Germany, to which he seems to have been invited by the
placing a large Magazine with a small guard in an unarmed town
within a day's march of the large garrison of Landau. In short,
that circumstance and the negociations at St. Menehould and the
retreat of the combined armies<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> have totally deranged all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
notions of dignity, generalship, preponderance of military discipline,
&amp;c., &amp;c., and all my speculations, moral, religious, political, and
military, are sent into a troubled sea without rudder or compass.
I had always some anxiety concerning the subsistence of a very
large army from the Frontier to Paris, if the French should make
up their mind to, and they could, lay waste the country, destroying
forage, &amp;c.; but I had never supposed the enterprise would end
so abruptly in disgrace and calamity. I now see no prospect of
any speedy settlement of French disturbances. The miscreants
at Paris, encouraged by an appearance of success, will be active
to extend their mischiefs, and my apprehensions are by no means
quiet with respect to our own affairs.</p>

<p>Among the Dissenters it is thought there are a great many
disposed to change. I am very far from satisfied with Charles
Fox, much less with Gray, Lord Lauderdale, &amp;c. Even in the
trumpery town of Lewes there are some who hold meetings and
correspond with certain Societies of the worst kind in the Borough,
and of which you have probably heard; one of the creatures at
Lewes said lately that, if the French business succeeded in any
degree, it was perfectly sure that England would be in the same
state as France is now in, before the end of ten years, and another
declared that England would never do well until 5000 of the
Nobility &amp; Gentry were hung up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCONTENT IN IRELAND.</div>

<p>Ireland is in no slight degree of alarm.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The Roman Catholicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
are much discontented. A ship-load of arms was lately landed
for the discontented in the North. They have the impudence
to exercise even in the neighbourhood of Drogheda. The natives
return to their old tricks of shooting <em>Christians</em> in a most
treacherous manner, and even in what is called the most civilized
parts, and of houghing <em>Protestant cattle</em>. If the Government of
Ireland continues to be feeble and not to act with firmness it
may be difficult to say how matters will end&mdash;but there never was
a time less favourable to the insurrection of Roman Catholicks,
than the moment when it will not be possible for them to have
assistance from foreign countries.</p>

<p>I am sorry the early meeting of Parliament which I announced
to you, is not confirmed, yet I think it would have been a wise
measure to have brought men together early, and not to have
suffered the impressions made by the extravagance and cruelty
of the Jacobins to wear out, or perhaps to receive a contrary
direction. The worst cause when it seems fortunate will find
defenders perhaps, but certainly will not want partisans.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moss<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> has sent us a curious account of the dismay which
took place in the Geneva State on the incursion into Savoy; but
amidst all the calamities, we are glad to find from her, you are in
good condition. I consider the French affairs so far out of the
line of common Politicks, that I wish the whole world to declare
against them, and run them down as pestiferous wolves, and
therefore I wish all Switzerland to join against them; but I
doubt whether it will be the policy of that country to engage in
offensive war; and I suppose Geneva will not admit Swiss troops,
if it will bring on a bombardment. I cannot conceive why some
of the passes into Savoy were not defended. I long to hear that
the retreat of the French is cut off. I am sorry I can see no
prospect of the interference of this country. I think we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
at least tell them, they must not fit out fleets against Nice or any
place. Among many correspondents, and some of them the best
informed, I find there is not the most distant guess of the
intentions of Government. Perhaps they have no plan.</p>

<p>I believe my last mentioned that I have been much employed,
by an attention to the poor refugees. Lally has been here and is
gone, to return in a few days with the princess d'Henin and the
Pauline.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> We have had the most curious details, and just now,
from some respectable priests who were shut up with the Archbishop
of Arles, &amp;c., when the latter were massacred. Possibly
you may not have so good an account at Lausanne, therefore I
shall urge Maria to write it to you. The late massacres<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> are
infinitely more execrable than any French or English paper have
stated.</p>

<p>We are exceedingly sorry to hear by Mrs. Moss, that M. de
Severy is ill. You shall hear no more from hence untill you write
to us.</p>

<p>*Since my last, our affairs take a more pacific turn; but I will
not venture to affirm that our peace will be either safe or honourable.
Mr. de Montesquiou and three Commissioners of the
Convention, who are at Carrouge, have had several conferences
with the Magistrates of Geneva; several expresses have been
dispatched to and from Paris, and every step of the negotiation
is communicated to the deputies of Bern and Zurich. The French
troops observe a very tolerable degree of order and discipline:
and no act of hostility has yet been committed on the territory
of Geneva.*</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARMÉE MONTESQUIEU.</div>

<p>The amiable family at S. P. being infinitely delighted with
your welcome dispatch, &amp; still more so with the promise of writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<em>every week</em>, have had a dispute amongst themselves, who was
to have the honor of answering you, &amp; reminding you of that
promise. I have gained permission to be the happy person, &amp;
happy I shall think myself, if you should direct <em>one</em> of the promised
Letters to me. We talk and think of nothing but foreign news,
&amp; Mama is very abusive of the Jacobins. Massacres have sometimes
enraged me a little, but I have borne every thing with
tolerable patience, except that Wretches, who have no other idea
of liberty, than the liberty of murdering defenceless prisoners,
should dare to think of attacking a Nation, whose Ideas of freedom
are not so <em>refined</em> as theirs, &amp; whose valour is almost proverbial.
Though I am perfectly satisfied that the tricolor Banner will never
be erected in the town of Lausanne, yet I am very anxious to hear
what becomes of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Armée Montesquiou</i>. I am always wishing
myself the guardian Angel of the Pais de Vaud. If I was, I am
sure I should be inspired to do wonders. But, alas! I am a
poor Mortal, &amp; can only assist that Country by my best Wishes
for its safety &amp; prosperity.</p>

<p>How I wish you had let us remain &amp; vegetate in our own
little Island. I should have felt no other Interest in what is
passing in your part of the World, than joy that you would be
obliged to return to your native Country. You have likewise
to answer for making me disatisfied with the famous Lakes &amp;
Rivers in the County of Sussex; &amp; for shewing me a Country
to which no other can compare, &amp; which to see again I would
give all my share of My lord's Sheep and Oxen, Ponds &amp; Rivers.
I do not know how to reconcile my wishes for the peace of
Switzerland, with those for your return to England&mdash;as you
seem resolved not to indulge us with your company, unless you
are forced from your residence by a few thousand Marseillois.
I cannot tell you how much I was disappointed when I was
obliged to give up all expectation of seeing you this year. I
wrote to Angletine a fortnight ago. I am very sorry indeed to
hear her father is in a bad state of health. I hope you will
be able to give a good Account of him, when you write next.
Pray remember me to them very particularly, though I wish
you had never made me acquainted with people I may probably
never see again &amp; yet cannot forget.</p>

<p>Papa is gone down the River Ouse, &amp; ordered me to give you
an account of the Emigrants; he would not think I had obeyed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
very exactly, if he was to see my Letter&mdash;he would probably call it
Stuff and Nonsense. I hope <em>you</em> will not, tho' I always feel myself
so unworthy to write to you, that I generally suspect my poor
Letters meet with a degree of criticism I am sure they cannot bear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISTRESS OF FRENCH REFUGEES.</div>

<p>Now for Papa's Emigrants. The Duc de Liancourt,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> who will
have (when he can get it) the most considerable estate in France
by the death of the Duc de Rochefoucauld, has been waiting for
some weeks to come here, till Arthur Young should find it convenient
to set off, as he had offered the Duke a seat in his Post
chaise; he is in such distressed circumstances that his present
plan is to go &amp; settle in America. Mad<sup>e</sup>. de Biron, who came
over with so much difficulty and danger, that she lost her senses
from fright and alarm, is returned to France to avoid the
confiscation of her Estates. The same reason existing for her
remaining there when she left the Country, it seems an extraordinary
resolution to take, her returning, when she will be in as
great danger as before. Mad<sup>e</sup>. d'Henin<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> is settled at Richmond,
&amp; Mad<sup>lle</sup>. de Pully is arrived in England&mdash;we expect them here
every day. Lally told us, when he was here, D. of Fitzjames<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> was
living in Germany upon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quinze sous par jour</i>, &amp; saving out
of that pittance to send something to her sons in the Army. A
great number of french Priests have landed on our Coast.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
suppose my lord informed you of the arrival of two here who had
escaped from the Massacre at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Carmes</i>&mdash;the detail of the death
of the Archbishop of Arles is horrid, but too long for a Letter.
The subscriptions in London are very great&mdash;one for the Clergy
only, amounts to £12,000, &amp; that for both Clergy and Laity to
upwards of £4000. The latter has enabled some Swiss officers to
reach their own Country, who intended to beg their way thro'
Holland, &amp; supports some french Ladies of fashion who had
nothing but what they got by their needlework. Burke &amp; Papa
have had a vigorous correspondence on the subject&mdash;the former
is very indignant that a case he had drawn up about Atheists
calling themselves Philosophers in France was not received.</p>

<p>I do not dare <em>expect</em>, but I will <em>hope</em> to hear from you. Will
you be so good as to remember me to M. &amp; M<sup>e</sup>. Levade? Do you
know where the Legards and Grimstones are? Mama has some
doubts, as to how she shall receive you; if you are obliged to fly
to England, I shall be too well pleased with the effect to think
of the cause.</p>

<p>Mama desires a great many pretty things to you. She is
quite well &amp; in good spirits; how unlucky we could not say the
same last year. Louisa is still at Bath. I am in hopes of paying
her a visit there next month. She <em>raves</em> about Switz. <em>almost</em>
as much as me.</p>

<p>*My usual temper very readily admitted the excuse, that it
would be better to wait another week, till the final settlement of
our affairs. The treaty is signed between France and Geneva;
and the ratification of the Convention is looked upon as assured,
if any thing can be assured in that wild Democracy.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> On condition
that the Swiss Garrison, with the approbation of Berne and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Zurich, be recalled before the first of December, it is stipulated
that the independence of Geneva shall be preserved inviolate;
that M. de Montesquiou shall immediately send away his heavy
artillery; and that no French troops shall approach within ten
leagues of the city. As the Swiss have acted only as auxiliaries,
they have no occasion for a direct treaty; but they cannot
prudently disarm, till they are satisfied of the pacific intentions
of France; and no such satisfaction can be given till they have
acknowledged the new Republic, which they will probably do in
a few days, with a deep groan of indignation and sorrow; it has
been cemented with the blood of their countrymen! But when
the Emperor, the King of Prussia, the first General, and the first
army in Europe have failed, less powerful states may acquiesce,
without dishonour, in the determination of fortune. Do you
understand this most unexpected failure? I will allow an ample
share to the badness of the roads and the weather, to famine and
disease, to the skill of Dumourier, a heaven-born General, and to
the enthusiastic ardour of the new Romans; but still, still there
must be some secret shameful cause at the bottom of this strange
retreat.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A TUTORSHIP FOR SEVERY.</div>

<p>We are now delivered from the impending terrors of siege

but I am not pleased with our future prospects. It is much to
be feared that the present Government of Geneva will be soon
modelled after the French fashion; the new Republic of Savoy
is forming on the opposite bank of the lake; the Jacobin
Missionaries are powerful and zealous; and the Malcontents of

There must surely be some disorder in the posts, since the Eliza
departed indignant at never having heard from you.*</p>

<p>I still am of opinion that it is both unseemly and unusual for
<em>us</em> to propose any specific terms. You must hear the ideas of the
parents or guardians. You must consider on the behalf of your
client, how far a moderate interest may be enhanced by rank and
character, how far a deficiency (less desirable) in those qualifications
may be varnished with gold. If everything should unite,
you may boldly accept; if you hesitate you must take the matter
ad referendum, and they must expect our answer by the return of
the post. You will say perhaps that the parties may be impatient,
and that delay may be productive of danger. This I must
acknowledge, nor is it only in this respect that I feel the disadvantage
of his not being on the spot.&mdash;I much regret the
M[arquis] of C[armarthen], his father the D[uke] of L[eeds] is a
fair and honourable man. Your hint of General Bude (of whom
I had never heard) shall not be neglected: when the Duchess of
D. returns to England next year, I hope she will be able and
willing to assist the young man, to whom she expressed much
friendship, and whom she appointed her chevalier sans peur
and sans reproche by the delivery of a feather and a cockade.
He is now on service with his dragoons, but will probably be
soon disbanded.</p>

<p>Without confessing that my fears and scruples were quite so
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anile</i> as you are always disposed to think them, I am now in a
great measure satisfied. I wish you may find a secure mortgage
at four per cent.; but though I do not perfectly like the
Debentures (which you never explained before), I cannot think
they run much risk till our next meeting in England.</p>

<p>The case of my Wine I think peculiarly hard; to lose my
Madeira, and to be scolded for losing it. Please to remember
that the Wine Merchant never sent me any letter of advice, as he
ought to have done, of the time and manner of its departure; and
that when I first expressed my astonishment to you (in my great
letter of at least four months ago) you were too much engrossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
with a more interesting subject to return any answer. What
could I do? my part was entirely passive, to expect its arrival,
which I still expect. Yet I have now directed proper enquiries
to be made at Basle and Ostend; the London Merchant must
trace it forwards, and the last person in whose hands it has been
must be responsible for the wine or its value. Whatsoever may
be right, I have no intention of seeking a legal remedy; but on
a similar occasion, I hope we shall never repeat the liberal confidence
of such premature payment.</p>

<p>*I am much indebted to Mr. Nichols for his Genealogical communications,
which I am impatient to receive; but I do not
understand why so civil a Gentleman could not favour me, in
six months, with an answer by the post: since he entrusts me
with these valuable papers, you have not, I presume, informed
him of my negligence and awkwardness in regard to Manuscripts.
Your reproach rather surprizes me, as I suppose I am much the
same as I have been for these last twenty Years. Should you hold
your resolution of writing only such things as may be published
at Charing-cross, our future correspondence would not be very
interesting. But I expect and require, at this important crisis,
a full and confidential account of your views concerning England,
Ireland, and France. You have a strong and clear eye; and your
pen is, perhaps, the most useful quill that ever has been plucked
from a goose. Your protection of the French refugees is highly
applauded. Rosset and La Motte have escaped from Arbourg,
perhaps with connivance to avoid disagreeable demands from
the Republic. Adieu.*</p>

<p>Here I am, not on account of my eyes (which continue very

thence I moved to this place with the Maria, whom I shall leave
with Aunt while I go through the necessary duties at Bristol,
which will at least engage me till the 13th instant. Talking
of Downing Street, I should mention the extraordinary <em>occurrence</em>
in the dining-room there a few days since, of the three late
French Ministers, St. Croix,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Monciel,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Bertrand<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and also Malouet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>

Committee on their deplorable affairs. For the sake of my eyes
I shall give this to be finished by Maria. No man has a guess
at the intentions of Gouvernment. There is not the slightest
expectation that they will take the least part in the affairs of
France. All those members of Opposition for whom you or
others have respect are seriously well disposed to a junction of
parties, and I am convinced, indeed I know, they would be very
reasonable in their expectations. Pitt has said he could act in
great confidence with Fox, notwithstanding sparrings which have
taken place, and Charles Fox has said that a junction is so right
a thing, that he cannot see otherwise than that it must take
place. Yet there are great difficulties, and I am not sanguine.
I shall have no opinion of Pitt's judgment or disposition if he
does not remove them.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Gibbon was given over last week, a bilious attack.
She has miraculously recovered, but the man who has bodily care
of her, says she is so worn, she cannot pass the winter.</p>

<p>I should have added above that I fear Fox will be still
<em>detestable</em> on the subject of French affairs. Pitt is suspected of
Democracy, and it is said by some lately that he will himself move
a Plan of Reform next Sessions.</p>

Mr. Batt told us last Friday that the Attorney General had had
information of the following event at Manchester, and that the
said Attorney General had mentioned it to the <em>said</em> Mr. Batt.
A person (we did not hear his name) at that place invited a

notice there would be a <em>ceremony</em>. When the company was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>

a Blue Ribband, Crown and Sceptre, &amp;c., which after many
ridiculous formalities was killed, cut in pieces, and sent to
different Societies in this Kingdom. I do not know if Lewes
had a portion, but I know there is a Jacobin Society there.
Burke called here yesterday evening to talk of a Plan for permanent
relief of the poor priests, giving up all hopes of their
returning to their native country. He proposed with the money

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
November 10th, 1792.
</p>

<p>*Received this day, November 9th, a most amiable dispatch
from the too humble secretary<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> of the family of Espee,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> dated
October 24th, which I answer the same day. It will be acknowledged,
that I have fulfilled my engagement with as much accuracy
as our uncertain state and the fragility of human nature would
allow.</p>

<p>I resume my narrative. At the time when we imagined that
all was settled by an equal treaty between two such unequal
powers, as the Geneva flea and the Leviathan France, we were
thunderstruck with the intelligence that the Ministers of the
Republic refused to ratify the conditions; and they were indignant,
with some colour of reason, at the hard obligation of withdrawing
their troops to the distance of ten leagues, and of
consequently leaving the Pays de Gex naked, and exposed to the
Swiss, who had assembled 15,000 men on the frontier, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
whom they had not made any agreement. The Messenger who
was sent last Sunday from Geneva is not yet returned; and many
persons are afraid of some design and danger in this delay.
Montesquiou has acted with politeness, moderation, and apparent
sincerity; but he may resign, he may be superseded, his place
may be occupied by an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enragé</i>,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> by Servan, or prince Charles of
Hesse,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> who would aspire to imitate the predatory fame of Custine
in Germany.</p>

<p>In the mean while, the General holds a wolf by the ears;
an officer who has seen his troops, about 18,000 men (with a
tremendous train of artillery), represents them as a black,
daring, desperate crew of buccaneers, rather shocking than contemptible;
the officers (scarcely a Gentleman among them), without
servants, or horses, or baggage, lying <em>higgledy piggledy</em> on the
ground with the common men, yet maintaining a rough kind of
discipline over them. They already begin to accuse and even to
suspect their General, and call aloud for blood and plunder:
could they have an opportunity of squeezing some of the rich
Citizens, Geneva would cut up as fat as most towns in Europe.
During this suspension of hostilities they are permitted to visit
the City without arms, sometimes three or four hundred at a
time; and the Magistrates, as well as the Swiss Commander, are
by no means pleased with this dangerous intercourse, which they
dare not prohibit. Such are our fears; yet it should seem on the
other side, that the French affect a kind of magnanimous justice
towards their little neighbour, and that they are not ambitious of
an unprofitable contest with the poor and hardy Swiss. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Swiss are not equal to a long and expensive War; and as most of
our Militia have families and trades, the country already sighs for
their return. Whatever can be yielded, without absolute danger
or disgrace, will doubtless be granted; and the business will
probably end in our owning the Sovereignty, and trusting to the
good faith of the Republic of France: how that word would
have sounded four years ago! The measure is humiliating; but
after the retreat of the Duke of Brunswick, and the failure of the
Austrians, the smaller powers may acquiesce without dishonour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND THE LAST REFUGE OF LIBERTY.</div>

<p>Every dog has his day; and these Gallic dogs have their day, at
least, of most insolent prosperity. After forcing or tempting the
Prussians to evacuate their country, they conquer Savoy, pillage
Germany, threaten Spain: the Low Countries are ere now invaded;
Rome and Italy tremble; they scour the Mediterranean, and talk
of sending a squadron into the South Sea. The whole horizon is
so black, that I begin to feel some anxiety for England, the last
refuge of liberty and law; and the more so, as I perceive from
Lord S.'s last epistle that his firm nerves are a little shaken;
but of this more in my next, for I want to unburthen my
conscience.</p>

<p>If England, with the experience of our happiness and French
calamities, should now be seduced to eat the apple of false freedom,
we should indeed deserve to be driven from the paradise which
we enjoy. I turn aside from the horrid and improbable, (yet not
impossible) supposition, that, in three or four years' time, myself
and my best friends may be reduced to the deplorable state of the
French emigrants: they thought it as impossible three or four
years ago. Never did a revolution affect, to such a degree, the
private existence of such numbers of the first people of a great
Country: your examples of misery I could easily match with
similar examples in this country and the neighbourhood; and our
sympathy is the deeper, as we do not possess, like you, the means
of alleviating, in some degree, the misfortunes of the fugitives.
But I must have, from the very excellent pen of the Maria, the
tragedy of the Archbishop of Arles; and the longer the better.
Madame de Biron has probably been tempted by some faint and
(I fear) fallacious promises of clemency to the Women, and which
have likewise engaged Madame d'Aguesseau and her two daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
to revisit France. Madame de Bouillon<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> stands her ground, and
her situation as a foreign princess is less exposed. As Lord S.
has assumed the glorious character of protector of the distressed,
his name is pronounced with gratitude and respect. The D. of
Richmond is praised, on Madame de Biron's account. To the
Princess d'Henin, and Lally, I wish to be remembered.</p>

<p>The Neckers cannot venture into Geneva, and Madame de
Stael will probably lye in at Rolle. He is printing a defence of
the King, &amp;c., against their Republican Judges;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> but the name
of Necker is unpopular to all parties, and I much fear that the
Guillotine will be more speedy than the press. It will, however,
be an eloquent performance; and, if I find an opportunity, I
am to send you one, to you, Lord S., by his particular desire:
he wishes likewise to convey some copies with speed to our
principal people, Pitt, Fox, Lord Stormont, &amp;c. But such is the
rapid succession of events, that it will appear, like the 'Pouvoir
Executif,' his best Work, after the whole scene has been totally
changed.*</p>

<p>Shall you never be able to place my £3000 on good Security?
Was there ever before a two years' fruitless chace after a Mortgage?
We are in hot pursuit from all quarters of my Madeira,
and unless already drunk by the Hussars it must emerge.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;*The Revolution of France, and my triple dispatch by
the same post to Sheffield-place, are, in my opinion, the two most
singular events in the eighteenth Century. I found the task so
easy and pleasant, that I had some thoughts of adding a letter
to the gentle Louisa.* And a note to the most respectable Tuft.
I should not have forgot Miss Firth, but I hear she is leaving
you. Is she going to be married? *I am this moment informed,
that our troops on the frontier are beginning to move, on their
return home; yet we hear nothing of the treaty's being concluded.*</p>

<h3><em>To Lady Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, November 10, 1792.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEITHER MONSTER NOR STATUE.</div>

<p>*I could never forgive myself, were I capable of writing by the
same post, a political Epistle to the father, and a friendly letter
to the daughter, without sending any token of remembrance to
the respectable Matron, my dearest My lady, whom I have now
loved as a sister for something better or worse than twenty years.
No, indeed, the historian may be careless, he may be indolent, he
may always intend and never execute, but he is neither a monster
nor a statue; he has a memory, a conscience, a heart, and that
heart is sincerely devoted to Lady S. He must even acknowledge
the fallacy of a sophism which he has sometimes used, and she
has always and most truly denied; that, where the persons of a
family are strictly united, the writing to one is in fact writing to
all; and that consequently all his numerous letters to the husband,
may be considered as equally addressed to the wife. He feels, on
the contrary, that separate minds have their distinct ideas and
sentiments, and that each character, either in speaking or writing,
has its peculiar tone of conversation. He agrees with the maxim
of Rousseau, that three friends who wish to disclose a common
secret, will impart it only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux à deux</i>; and he is satisfied that,
on the present memorable occasion, each of the persons of the
Sheffield family will claim a peculiar share in this triple missive,
which will communicate, however, a triple satisfaction. The
experience of what may be effected by vigorous resolution, encourages
the historian to hope that he shall cast the skin of the
old serpent, and hereafter show himself as a new creature.*</p>

<p>And first let me congratulate yourself and your friends on the
present happy state of your mental and corporeal faculties, of which
I have gained the pleasing intelligence, not only from the hints
in Lord S. and Maria's letters, but still more clearly from your
own long and spirited Epistle to young Severy, which he received
with gratitude and will answer with speed.</p>

<p>*I lament, on all our accounts, that the last year's expedition
to Lausanne did not take place in a golden period;* the more
familiar and cheerful intercourse with Madame de Severy would
have opened your hearts to each other. I should have escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
many moments of painful though silent sympathy, and every
object in Nature and society would have appeared to your eyes
with a different aspect and colour. *But we must reflect, that
human felicity is seldom without alloy; and if we cannot indulge
the hope of your making a second visit to Lausanne, we must
look forwards to my residence next summer at Sheffield-place,
where I must find you in the full bloom of health, spirits, and
beauty. I can perceive, by all public and private intelligence,
that your house has been the open hospital Azylum of French
fugitives; and it is a sufficient proof of the firmness of your
nerves, that you have not been overwhelmed or agitated by such
a concourse of strangers. Curiosity and compassion may, in some
degree, have supported you. Every day has presented to your
view some new scene of that strange tragical romance, which
occupies all Europe so infinitely beyond any event that has
happened in our time, and you have the satisfaction of not being
a mere spectator of the distress of so many victims of false liberty.
The benevolent fame of Lord S. is widely diffused.</p>

<p>From Angletine's last letter to Maria, you have already some
idea of the melancholy state of her poor father. As long as Mr.
de Severy allowed our hopes and fears to fluctuate with the
changes of his disorder, I was unwilling to say anything on so
painful a subject; and it is with the deepest concern that I now
confess our absolute despair of his recovery. All his particular
complaints are now lost in a general dissolution of the whole
frame: every principle of life is exhausted, and as often as I am
admitted to his bed-side, though he still looks and smiles with
the patience of an Angel, I have the heartfelt grief of seeing him
each day drawing nearer to the term of his existence. A few
weeks, possibly a few days, will deprive me of a most excellent
friend, and break for ever the most perfect system of domestic
happiness, in which I had so large and intimate a share. Wilhelm
(who has obtained leave of absence from his military duty) and
his sister behave and feel like tender and dutiful children; but
they have a long gay prospect of life, and new connexions, new
families will make them forget, in due time, the common lot of
mortality. But it is Madame de Severy whom I truly pity; I
dread the effects of the first shock, and I dread still more the
deep perpetual consuming affliction for a loss which can never be
retrieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">GIBBON'S ALTERED SITUATION.</div>

<p>You will not wonder that such reflections sadden my own
mind, nor can I forget how much my situation is altered
since I retired, nine years ago, to the banks of the Leman lake.
The death of poor Deyverdun first deprived me of a domestic
companion, who can never be supplied; and your visit has only
served to remind me that man, however amused and occupied in
his Closet, was not made to live alone. Severy will soon be no
more; his widow for a long time, perhaps for ever, will be lost
to herself and her friends, the son will travel, and I shall be left
a stranger in the insipid circle of mere common acquaintance.
The Revolution of France, which first embittered and divided
the Society of Lausanne, has opposed a barrier to my Sussex visit,
and may finally expell me from the paradise which I inhabit.
Even that paradise, the expensive and delightful establishment of
my house, library, and garden, almost becomes an incumbrance,
by rendering it more difficult for me to relinquish my hold, or
to form a new system of life in my native Country, for which my
income, though improved and improving, would be probably
insufficient. But every complaint should be silenced by the
contemplation of the French; compared with whose cruel fate,
all misery is relative happiness. I perfectly concurr in your
partiality for Lally; though Nature might forget some meaner
ingredients, of prudence, economy, &amp;c., she never formed a purer
heart, or a brighter imagination. If he be with you, I beg my
kindest salutations to him. I am every day more closely united
with the Neckers. Should France break, and this country be
over-run, they would be reduced, in very humble circumstances,
to seek a refuge; and where but in England? Adieu, dear
Madam: there is, indeed, much pleasure in discharging one's
heart to a real friend.*</p>

<h3><em>To the Hon. Maria Holroyd.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, Nov. 10, 1792.
</p>

<p>In dispatching the weekly political journal to Lord Sheffield,
my conscience (for I have some remains of conscience) most
powerfully urges me to salute, with some lines of friendship and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
gratitude, the amiable secretary, who might save herself the
trouble of a modest apology. I have not yet forgotten our
different behaviour after the much lamented <em>separation</em> of
October the 4th, 1791, your meritorious punctuality, and my
unworthy silence. I have still before me that entertaining
narrative, which would have interested me, not only in the progress
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carissima famiglia</i>, but in the motions of a Tartar
camp, or the march of a caravan of Arabs; the mixture of just
observation and lively imagery, the strong sense of a man,
expressed with the easy elegance of a female. I still recollect
with pleasure the happy comparison of the Rhine, who had heard
so much of liberty on both his banks, that he wandered with
mischievous licentiousness over all the adjacent meadows. The
inundation, alas! has now spread much wider; and it is sadly to
be feared that the Elbe, the Po, and the Danube, may imitate the
vile example of the Rhine: I shall be content, however, if our
own Thames still preserves his fair character of</p>

<p class="center">
Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.
</p>

<p>These agreeable epistles of Maria produced only some dumb
intentions, and some barren remorse; nor have I deigned, except
by a brief missive from my chancellor, to express how much I
loved the author, and how much I was pleased with the composition.
That amiable author I have known and loved from the
first dawning of her life and <em>coquetry</em>, to the present maturity of
her talents; and as long as I remain on this planet, I shall pursue,
with the same tender and even anxious concern, the future steps
of her establishment and life. That establishment must be
splendid; that life must be happy. She is endowed with every
gift of nature and fortune; but the advantage which she will
derive from them, depends almost entirely on herself. You must
not, you shall not, think yourself unworthy to write to any man:
there is none whom your correspondence would not amuse and
satisfy.</p>

<p>I will not undertake a task, which my taste would adopt, and
my indolence would too soon relinquish; but I am really curious,
from the best motives, to have a particular account of your own
studies and daily occupation. What books do you read? and
how do you employ your time and your pen? Except some professed
scholars, I have often observed that women in general read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
much more than men; but, for want of a plan, a method, a fixed
object, their reading is of little benefit to themselves, or others.
If you will inform me of the species of reading to which you have
the most propensity, I shall be happy to contribute my share of
advice or assistance.</p>

<p>I lament that you have not left me some monument of your
pencil. Lady Elizabeth Foster has executed a very pretty drawing,
taken from the door of the green-house where we dined last
summer, and including the poor Acacia, (now recovered from the
cruel shears of the gardener,) the end of the terrace, the front
of the Pavilion, and a distant view of the country, lake, and
mountains. I am almost reconciled to d'Apples' house, which is
nearly finished. Instead of the monsters which Lord Hercules
Sheffield extirpated, the terrace is already shaded with the new
acacias and plantanes; and although the uncertainty of possession
restrains me from building, I myself have planted a bosquet at
the bottom of the garden, with such admirable skill that it affords
shade without intercepting prospect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCIETY OF LADY E. FOSTER.</div>

<p>The society of the aforesaid Eliza, of the Duchess of Devonshire,
&amp;c. has been very interesting; but they are now flown
beyond the Alps, and pass the winter at Pisa. The Legards, who
have long since left this place, should be at present in Italy; but
I believe Mrs. Grimstone and her daughter returned to England.
The Levades are highly flattered by your remembrance. Since
you still retain some attachment to this delightful country, and
it is indeed delightful, why should you despair of seeing it once
more? The happy peer or commoner, whose name you may
assume, is still concealed in the book of fate; but, whosoever he
may be, he will cheerfully obey your commands, of leading you
from &mdash;&mdash; Castle to Lausanne, and from Lausanne to Rome
and Naples. Before that event takes place, I may possibly see
you in Sussex; and, whether as a visitor or a fugitive, I hope to
be welcomed with a friendly embrace. The delay of this year
was truly painful, but it was inevitable; and individuals must
submit to those storms which have overturned the thrones of the
earth.</p>

<p>The tragic story of the Archbishop of Arles I have now somewhat
a better right to require at your hands. I wish to have it
in all its horrid details; and as you are now so much mingled
with the French exiles, I am of opinion, that were you to keep a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
journal of all the authentic facts which they relate, it would be an
agreeable exercise at present, and a future source of entertainment
and instruction.</p>

<p>I should be obliged to you, if you would make, or find, some
excuse for my not answering a letter from your aunt, which was
presented to me by Mr. Fowler. I shewed him some civilities,
but he is now a poor invalid, confined to his room. By her
channel and yours I should be glad to have some information of
the health, spirits, and situation of Mrs. Gibbon of Bath, whose
alarms (if she has any) you may dispel. She is in my debt.
Adieu; most truly yours.</p>

<h3><em>The Hon. Maria Holroyd to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, November, 1792.
</p>

<p>Your three letters received yesterday caused the most sincere
pleasure to each individual of this family so highly favoured by
you&mdash;but to none more than myself. I flatter myself that I
despise general compliments as they deserve, but praise (tho' I
fear, beyond my deserts) from one whose opinion I so highly value,
and whose esteem I so much wish to gain, is more pleasing than
I can describe, &amp; I really think, thus encouraged, &amp; with your
<em>example</em> before me, to shew <em>bad habits may</em> be conquered. I had
not neglected to make the collection of facts which you recommend,
and which the great variety of unfortunate persons whom
we see, or with whom we correspond, enables me to make.</p>

<p>As to the other part of your letter about <em>my studies</em>, I
can only say, the slightest hint on that subject will be always
received with the greatest gratitude, and attended to with
the utmost punctuality. French history I am most acquainted
with&mdash;English, I am ashamed to say, I am much less versed in.
I have read Hume, but not since I came to years of discretion, &amp;
what is read as a <em>task</em> seldom is well attended to. I am now
reading a <em>certain</em> work, in 6 Vols. Quarto or 12 Duodecimo, which
I was acquainted with before, only by reading it after supper,
frequently with long interruptions caused by Company, &amp;c., &amp;
which only raised my curiosity to give it more attention. It
would be Impertinence or at best but a Drop in the Ocean to add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
my mite to the opinion of the generality of the World, &amp; say
how much the Subject interests or the Style delights me. When
this work is read thro', I intend to proceed with English history.
I again repeat, if you condescend to favour me with any directions
on this subject, I shall follow them with the greatest pleasure;
but if you should not, I am much flattered that you should desire
to hear from me, &amp; should have sent you the horrid account of
the massacre aux Carmes before, if I had thought you would have
been desirous of it. I have not seen the details in any newspaper,
&amp; one of the eight Priests, who dined here, &amp; had escaped
from the massacre, related the whole with such simplicity &amp;
feeling, as to leave no doubt of the truth of all he said.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MURDER OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF ARLES.</div>

<p>On the 2<sup>d</sup> of Sep<sup>ber</sup> they went into the garden, as usual, to
walk at five o'clock in the evening. They expressed their surprize
at several large pits, which had been digging for two or three
days past. They said to each other, "The day is almost spent,
&amp; yet Manuel<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> told a person who interceded for us, last Thursday,
that on the Sunday following not one should remain in captivity&mdash;we
are still Prisoners." Soon after, they heard shouts, and some
musquet shots were fired into the Garden. A number of National
Guards, some Commissaires <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Sections</i>, &amp; several Marseillois,
rushed in. The unhappy victims who were dispersed about the
Garden, assembled under the Walls of the Church, not daring
to enter, least it should be polluted with blood. One, who was
behind the rest, was shot dead. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Point de coups de fusil</i> said some
of the Chiefs of the assassins, thinking this death too merciful.
A number of them called for the Archbishop of Arles,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> &amp; insisted
that he should be given up to them, the Priests all crowded
round him, &amp; determined to defend him with their Lives. The
Archbishop then said, "Let me pass; if we must all perish, it is
of little consequence whether I die first or not, &amp; if my death
will appease them, is it not my duty to preserve your Lives at
the expense of my own?" He asked the eldest of the Priests
to give him Absolution&mdash;he knelt to receive it, &amp; when he rose,
advanced, with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the People.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
His appearance was so dignified &amp; noble, that for ten minutes
not one of these Wretches had courage to raise their hand against
him. They reproached each other with cowardice &amp; advanced&mdash;one
look from the venerable Prelate struck them with involuntary
awe, &amp; they retired. At last, one of the assassins struck off his
Cap with a Pike&mdash;their fury returned when they saw respect once
violated, &amp; another struck him on the head with a Sabre, &amp;
laid open his scalp. The Archbishop only said, "O mon Dieu!"
&amp; put up his right hand to his eyes. A second blow cut off
this hand&mdash;he repeated his exclamation &amp; raised the other. A
third stroke left him sitting, &amp; a fourth extended him lifeless,
when all the Miscreants pressed forwards, to bury their Poniards
in his bosom.</p>

<p>The Priests all agreed that the Archbishop of Arles was
one of the most amiable men in France&mdash;his only <em>crime</em> was
having parted with most of his private fortune to support
the necessitous Clergy of his Diocese, since the beginning of
the Revolution. When he was murdered, the National Guards
made all the Priests go into the Church, telling them they should
appear, one after another, before the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commissaires du Section</i>,
who would try them and determine their fate. They had
hardly entered, before the People impatiently called for them to
shew themselves&mdash;upon which, all kneeling before the Altar,
they received Absolution from the B<sup>p</sup> of Beauvais&mdash;&amp; then, two
by two, passed before one of the commissaires, who did not
question, but only counted his victims. In this manner, perished
120 Priests, amongst whom were the Bishops of Beauvais and
Xaintes, both of the Rochefoucauld family.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> <em>Our friends</em> escaped
by getting over the Wall.</p>

<p>I am afraid I have tired your patience, &amp; that you did not
expect such a tedious history. Mad<sup>e</sup>. d'Hénin &amp; Pauline are at
Boulogne; they have gained nothing by going there, &amp; are
afraid they may find it difficult returning to England. The
seal of the Nation is put on all Mad<sup>e</sup>. d'Hénin's effects; she is
not able to keep a single servant&mdash;she says, Pauline &amp; she must
wait on each other. Papa, who is more alarmed than I ever
saw him, will write to you soon, <em>politically</em>. Mama will likewise
answer your letter, &amp; in the mean time desires many thanks for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
it. Will you say everything affectionate to Angletine for her
letter? I feel sincerely for the situation of that family, &amp; if
you can send any good news of M. de Severy's amendment, I
trust you will write. It was particularly kind of Angletine to
write when her mind must be so ill at ease&mdash;but it is not flung
away upon me. I am anything but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une Ingrate</i>. Mrs. Moss is
here, &amp; speaks with delight of your house, your terrace, &amp; of
the great civility you showed her. Judge if Lausanne is ever the
subject of our conversation.</p>

<p>We left Louisa &amp; Aunt at Bath very well, they both desire
to be remembered to you when we wrote. Mrs. Gibbon looks
as well as ever, but is really very unwell.</p>

Bristol, 14th Nov., 1792.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FOOLISH GAME IN IRELAND.</div>

<p>I snatch an interval likely to be very short, to acknowledge
you have some merit in a 14th day epistle, although you fasted
as to your 7th day. I was glad to hear of the agreement on the
subject of Geneva. As the French troops were immediately to
return 10 leagues, and before the evacuation, I think it honourable,
but my political barometer never was so low. During
the last 35 years on no occasion it had materially sunk. It
never experienced any great depression till the wonderful and in
some degree inexplicable phenomena of the later part of last
September. I had some hope that Europe would see the necessity
of making a common cause against the Disturbers of the World.
But I have not a ray of hope. The failure of the combined
army has of course encouraged and increased a bad spirit in this
country, but it has not as yet shewn itself except in some towns.
And in such, mischief always begins. The respectable and considerable
men of both parties among my constituents are right.
Government had risked a foolish game in Ireland, playing Roman
Catholics against Protestants, and openly supporting the former,
granting too much, and giving further hopes, which has produced
sedition and brought them to the brink of rebellion, but within
a few weeks it has been determined to go no farther and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
support the Protestant Ascendency&mdash;better late than never, but
some knocks probably will ensue.</p>

<p>I believe I forgot to assure you in my last that Newspaper
account of our friend Lord L.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and his acceptance of Seals is
premature, and that there is no prospect of such an event unless
with the concurrence and accession of the Mass of the party.
I rather suspect some of our friends have more of the shew than
the reality, of wishing or expecting, or promoting healthy conjunction
of parties&mdash;but they are few.</p>

<p>I scolded you about the Madeira because I thought it lost
thro' your neglect of writing, but I have the pleasure of
finding that it was only delayed, and is now on its road. So
writes Muligan's correspondent in Holland. I shall send this to
Maria to finish. My eyes are very weak.</p>

<p>I do not know what to add to Papa's <em>croaking</em> Epistle, except
to ask if you will give us an Asylum at Lausanne when this
country is in the state of France. If you should answer in
the affirmative, I am afraid you would make me an enemy to
my country and wish it very ill. <em>I</em> think Papa very <em>ungrateful</em>
for your very great kindness and attention in writing so
frequently&mdash;at a time so very interesting, but I believe he is
afraid of praising you too much, least you should think you have
done enough. If you were a witness of the pleasure your letters
give all the family, I think you would not talk of sinking into
a <em>long and irreproachable silence</em>. Mama assures me you will
not write to me. Pray make her say the thing that is not, for
once in her life. We leave Bath next Sunday, after having
enjoyed the gaieties of the place a fortnight. Louisa is to
remain here all the Winter. She desires to be particularly remembered
to you. Switzerland is our daily subject of conversation
and regret. Witness our hands this 15th day of November.</p>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, Nov. 25th, 1792.
</p>

<p>*After the triple labour of my last dispatch, your experience
of the creature might tempt you to suspect that it would again
relapse into a long slumber. But, partly from the spirit of contradiction,
(though I am not a lady) and partly from the ease and
pleasure which I now find in the task, you see me again alive,
awake, and almost faithful to my hebdomadal promise. The last
week has not, however, afforded any events deserving the notice
of an historian. Our affairs are still floating on the waves of the
convention, and the ratification of a corrected treaty,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> which had
been fixed for the 20th, is not yet arrived; but the report of the
diplomatic committee has been favourable, and it is generally
understood that the leaders of the French Republic do not wish
to quarrel with the Swiss. We are gradually withdrawing and
disbanding our militia. Geneva will be left to sink or swim,
according to the humour of the people; and our last hope appears
to be, that by submission and good behaviour we shall avert for
some time the impending storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLIGHT OF A FRENCH GENERAL.</div>

<p>A few days ago, an odd incident happened in the French
army; the desertion of the general. As the Neckers were sitting,
about eight o'clock in the evening, in their drawing-room at
Rolle, the door flew open, and they were astounded by their
servant's announcing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le General de Montesquiou</i>! On
the receipt of some secret intelligence of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">decrét d'accusation</i>,
and an order to arrest him, he had only time to get on horseback,
to gallop through Geneva, to take boat for Coppet, and
to escape from his pursuers, who were ordered to seize him
alive or dead. He left the Neckers after supper, passed through
Lausanne in the night, and proceeded to Berne and Basle,
whence he intended to wind his way through Germany, amidst
enemies of every description, and to seek a refuge in England,
America, or the moon. He told Necker, that the sole remnant
of his fortune consisted in a wretched sum of twenty thousand
livres; but the public report, or suspicion, bespeaks him in much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
better circumstances. Besides the reproach of acting with too
much tameness and delay, he is accused of making very foul
and exorbitant contracts:<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> and it is certain that new Sparta
is infected with this vice beyond the example of the most
corrupt monarchy. Kellerman<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> is arrived to take the command;
and it is apprehended that on the first of December, after the
departure of the Swiss, the French may <em>request</em> the permission of
using Geneva, a friendly city, for their winter quarters. In that
case, the democratical revolution, which we all foresee, will be very
speedily effected.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>I would ask you, whether you apprehend there was any treason
in the Duke of Brunswick's retreat, and whether you have totally
withdrawn your confidence and esteem from that once-famed
general? Will it be possible for England to preserve her
neutrality with any honour or safety? We are bound, as I
understand, by treaty, to guarantee the dominions of the King
of Sardinia and the Austrian provinces of the Netherlands.
These countries are now invaded and over-run by the French.
Can we refuse to fulfil our engagements, without exposing ourselves
to all Europe as a perfidious or pusillanimous nation? Yet,
on the other hand, can we assist those allies, without plunging
headlong into an abyss, whose bottom no man can discover? But
my chief anxiety is for our domestic tranquillity; for I must
find a retreat in England, should I be driven from Lausanne.
The idea of firm and honourable union of parties pleases me
much; but you must frankly unfold what are the great difficulties
that may impede so salutary a measure: you write to a man
discreet in speech, and now careful of papers. Yet what can such
a coalition avail if Fox be detestable and Pitt democratical?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Where is the champion of the constitution? Alas, Lord Guildford!
I am much pleased with the Manchester ass. The asses
or wolves who sacrificed him have cast off the mask too soon;
and such a nonsensical act must open the eyes of many simple
patriots, who might have been led astray by the specious name of
reform. It should be made as notorious as possible. Next winter
may be the crisis of our fate, and if you begin to improve the
constitution, you may be driven step by step from the disfranchisement
of Old Sarum to the king in Newgate, the lords voted
useless, the bishops abolished, and a house of commons without
articles (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans culottes</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">MADAME DE STAEL.</div>

<p>Necker has ordered you a copy of his royal defence, which
has met with, and deserved, universal success. The pathetic
and argumentative parts are, in my opinion, equally good, and
his mild eloquence may persuade without irritating. I have
applied to this gentler tone some verses of Ovid (Metamorph.
1. iii. 302, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>) which you may read. Madame de Stael has
produced a second son. She talks wildly enough of visiting
England this winter.* Her friend the Vicomte de Narbonne is
somewhere about Dorking. If you could shew him any civilities
she would thank us both. She is a pleasant little woman.</p>

<p>No news from Basil or Ostend of my Madeira. Pray contrive
to get me a mortgage; there is nothing like land or landed
security. Poor Mrs. G. in such a state! I can only wish her an
easy dismission. I wish the same to poor Severy, whose *condition
is hopeless. Should he drag through the winter, Madame de S.
would scarcely survive him. She kills herself with grief and
fatigue. What a difference in Lausanne! I hope triple answers
are on the road. I must write soon; the <em>times</em> will not allow me
to read or think. Ever yours.*</p>

yesterday.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Your extraordinary effort to write so much would

to take up the political part of the correspondence. But you will
be satisfied with my occupation lately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONSTITUTION IS THE FRENZY.</div>

<p>Government had information (I know it to be very serious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and not from them). The sudden withdrawing of the Troops
from the coast to the City, the extraordinary assembling of
Parliament, the calling out of a part of the Militia, of course
caused great alarm, but the effect was good. The middle ranks
in town proposed Associations.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> I believe we began in Sussex.
I instantly took to it, gave a right direction, limited the business
to support of Constitution as now established, and of exerting
the Civil power which should be found necessary at this extraordinary
crisis instead of patchwork and partial association by
Towns. I have promoted one in each of the twelve Divisions
of the County. My Division meets first. The Plan ran like
wild-fire. The Constitution is the phrenzy more than Liberty,
property and no excise, or coalition ever was. All the parishes
in London are associating.</p>

<p>I had written the first page when the Princess d'Henin,
who left Boulogne yesterday, entered my room, and the now
immediate departure of post only allows me to say that Charles
Fox on moving the amendment of the Address<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> uttered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
most mischievous doctrines, principles, &amp;c., that could at this
time be invented, declaring himself, however, a friend to the
Constitution, yet admitting the necessity of some changes. We
(Country Gentlemen) opposed him, 290 to 50.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Lord Lansdown's
men included in the latter. Most of the others were
only with him because they thought it better not to throw him
out of all chance of control. Just as I came into this house I
met Lord Bute, who told me the Irish Catholicks were in arms.
Whether we shall have war with France is far from settled.</p>

<p>I shall write by next post.</p>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, 20th Dec., '92.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">JACOBINISM IN ENGLAND.</div>

<p>I wrote in much haste to you last Friday, and I know not at
this time what I wrote. I suppose I mentioned to you that Fox
had, contrary to the opinion of all the considerable and respectable
men of the Party, uttered everything that his worst enemy
could wish, and avowed everything which he seemed to keep back
last Sessions. It is impossible to imagine anything more injudicious
or more mischievous at this time. Every man in the
street asked, "Is he mad?" On the report of the address he
maintained still more extravagant language than the day before.
The next day, Saturday, he moved an Address to the King to
acknowledge and send an Embassy to the Republic, or to that
effect.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> I had been considerably <em>elevated</em> by his speeches of the
preceding day, and just before I came down to the House, I heard
that Brissot had announced in his newspaper of the 10th, as a
measure of Opposition, the acknowledgment of the Republic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
an Embassy. I did not suppose that Fox had any communication
with him, but it seemed that somebody who was in his councils
had connection with Brissot. Thus figged, the moment Fox sat
down, I burst, and expressed myself pretty vigorously, and I was
not sorry for the opportunity, as I knew the country gentlemen
were properly disposed, and I was glad to shew a <em>good example</em>.
Some followed strongly against Fox's conduct. The speeches are
wretchedly given in the common newspapers, but there is a good
report of what I said in the Diary and Morning Chronicle, and if
there should be room, Maria shall copy it at the end of this letter,
as it is not long.</p>

<p>Your last letter of the 26th Nov. is not the 6th, but the 5th
Bulletin of affairs in your neighbourhood. While you continue
to write you shall have frequent accounts from hence.</p>

<p>I had not an opportunity of learning distinctly whether Pitt
has at last positively declined the admission of Fox into Administration.
I have heard it said that he had, and that he had not,
both seemingly from good authority, but in truth I forgot to
enquire from the only quarter that could inform. The Duke of
Portland is greatly distressed by Fox's conduct&mdash;if he were to be
desired, he might become more desperate.&mdash;Lord Loughborough
is more vigorous in his opinion of the matter. There seems at
present no probability of his accepting the Great Seal. It would
be a situation of uncertainty, his acceptance would be reprobated,
and he would involve himself in much more trouble and difficulty
than at present; yet I do not see how Government can go on
without a considerable addition of force. It seems to me, however,
agreed among the better part of us in Opposition not to distress
or obstruct Government by opposition at this time. The business
is too serious. Jacobinism had lately slid rapidly through many
parts of the country. Emissaries of all sorts and in great numbers
have been very busy, and at a great expence.</p>

<p>I believe that I mentioned in a late letter that the Chief of
the Propaganda was here.&mdash;Rotombeau,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> the most execrable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
wretches, is here, and bragged that with his own hand he had
murdered the Lamballe and 38 persons in one day. Many
Frenchmen landed upon different parts of our coast with arms.
Some imported them regularly and paid duty for them. Several
men landed even near Ipswich with Fire-locks, Side-arms, and a
dagger. The officer commanding took them from them, and the
Mayor ordered them to be stored. The numbers in London were
very great&mdash;a very considerable number of persons there, and
especially in the Borough, were in concert with them. However
wild it may appear, the Plan was to surprize the Tower and to
deliver the hundred thousand muskets in the Armoury to the
people, who they supposed would follow them. The number who
have associated in the several clubs is said to consist of many
thousands. Government had notice that an attack would be
made on Sat. the 1st Decr. All the night of Friday Artillery and
Artillery-men were marching to the Tower from Woolwich, and
before day-break it was well-guarded. All this I know and not
from friends of Government. The Tower has since been much
strengthened; the gates fortified, the Ditch cleansed, and a considerable
body of men is now there. All the Cavalry and Regulars
within a hundred miles of London, were brought to its close
neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOX'S MISCHIEVOUS SPEECHES.</div>

<p>The country was of course alarmed, the shopkeepers at Lewes

disposition seems to have arisen at the same time in different parts
of England. Finding it likely to run, I have been very active
in giving it a direction. It appeared to me that nothing could
be more advantageous than arranging the minds of the people
under a good Principle, while they were in a ferment, and when
once committed by their signature, it was likely they would
be strenuous for measures which I endeavoured to make their
own, as much as possible. Every division of this county is
forming Associations to support the Civil Power, and declaring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
favour of a Government by King, Lords and Commons. The
spirit is going through the whole kingdom. The Jacobins seem
to be totally crushed and dismayed. Many French fled to the
Ports to secure a passage. Whether C. Fox's speeches will revive
them, I do not yet know, but they certainly will encourage many
of the miscreants within the country. I do not know whether
I mentioned to you the great facility with which several people,
even in this county, talk of the foolish expence of maintaining
a royal family. Association, giving an opportunity to such an
immense proportion of the people to shew their attachment to the
Constitution, has an excellent effect, and I have no doubt that
the French Devils on the excellent appearance of things will give
up their machinations. On the late explosion Rotombeau made
an attempt to fly&mdash;he was told he would be safer in London. He
is well <em>spied</em>&mdash;he sees four hundred persons in a day. I believe he
is now gone.</p>

<p>I came here on Sunday to attend a great meeting of Associations
(which I had promoted) on Monday. I intended to return,
but on Tuesday I wrote to the D. of Portland &amp; to Lord
Loughborough, and told them I was so disgusted with Fox's
conduct that I thought they would agree with me, that I had
better remain at Sheffield Place till Parliament meets for business
after Christmas. That I was sure a very small number of members
indeed would follow him in his present career. That, as a well-wisher
to the tranquility and safety of the country, I need not be
apprehensive of any mischief, except what may arise from the
language he holds, which cannot be prevented. That I do not
like to seem separate from men with whom I have zealously acted
ten out of the thirteen years of my political life.</p>


<p class="center"><br />(<em>Continued by the Hon. Maria Holroyd.</em>)</p>

<p>My Lord's Speech, taken from the Diary&mdash;he rose immediately
after Mr. Fox's motion for an Embassy to France. "It is
impossible to be silent. Are we then in that deplorable situation?
Are we the vilest and most contemptible of nations? Are we to
be the first to acknowledge, and cringe to these cut-throats and
robbers, who have not the recommendation of being able to
controul their own Banditti? Are we to league with them, to act
in concert with them? How soon they may be invited here, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
should not then attempt to guess&mdash;or to say how soon our gaols
may be filled with the most respectable persons of the Nation, for
the purpose of murdering them in cold blood without a trial&mdash;or
how soon the most amiable of our women and of the highest
ranks may lie on straw crowded in the most loathsome gaols, as in
France, with the lowest dregs of the people, faultless however,
except that their fathers, husbands, or sons may have ventured to
maintain the constitution; he should leave to others more able
than he was to detail the mischiefs of the monstrous proposition
that had been made. He was too much agitated to attempt it.
He was almost ashamed of the enthusiasm he had hitherto felt in
favour of the Right Honourable Mover. It is true he had made
much enquiry, but he hoped other country gentlemen would
communicate what they knew of the state of the country. In
respect to war, he believed every man wished to avert it. That
the surest means of avoiding it would be by vigorous preparation
for it, and if it could not be avoided, that it would be better
policy to meet it, than wait for it. That the Disturbers of the
World when they had over-run other nations, envying and dreading
our prosperity, would not fail with double force to visit us.
His Lordship concluded with some observations on the late
measures, and told the Ministers, that although he commended
their promptness and vigour, yet he could not approve their
unjustifiable interpretation of the word&mdash;Insurrection. They
would have done much better if they had acknowledged that, in
consequence of some uncommon danger which impended, they had
for the public good laid themselves under the necessity of
applying to the Legislature for indemnity, but that he had not
objected to the Address or supported the Amendment, because he
would not seem to countenance the many mischievous principles
and suggestions which had been heard in that House the last two
days from the Mover of the Amendment."</p>

<p>*Our little storm has now completely subsided, and we are
again spectators, though anxious spectators, of the general tempest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
that invades or threatens almost every country of Europe. Our
troops are every day disbanding and returning home, and the
greatest part of the French have evacuated the neighbourhood
of Geneva. Monsieur Barthelemy,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> whom you have seen secretary
in London, is most courteously entertained, as ambassador, by the
Helvetic body. He is now at Berne, where a Diet will speedily
be convened; the language on both sides is now pacific, and even
friendly, and some hopes are given of a provision for the officers
of the Swiss guards who have survived the Massacres of Paris.</p>


<p class="head"><br />
January 1st, 1793.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVOLUTION AT GENEVA.</div>

<p>With the return of peace I have relapsed into my former
indolence; but now awakening, after a fortnight's slumber, I have
little or nothing to add, with regard to the internal state of this
country, only the revolution of Geneva has already taken place,
as I announced, but sooner than I expected. The Swiss troops
had no sooner evacuated the place, than the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Egaliseurs</i>, as they are
called, assembled in arms; and as no resistance was made, no
blood was shed on the occasion. They seized the gates, disarmed
the garrison, imprisoned the magistrates, imparted the rights of
citizens to all the rabble of the town and country, and proclaimed
a <em>national</em> convention, which has not yet met. They are all for
a pure and absolute Democracy; but wish to remain a small
independent state, whilst others aspire to become a part of the
republic of France; and as the latter, though less numerous, are
more violent and absurd than their adversaries, it is highly
probable that they will succeed. The Citizens of the best families
and fortunes have retired from Geneva into the Pays de Vaud,
but the French methods of recalling or proscribing emigrants will
soon be adopted. You must have observed, that Savoy has now
become <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Department du Mont Blanc</i>. I cannot satisfy myself
whether the mass of the people is pleased or displeased with the
change; but my noble scenery is clouded by the democratical
aspect of twelve leagues of the opposite coast, which every
morning obtrude themselves on my view. I here conclude the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
first part of the history of our Alpine troubles, and now consider
myself as disengaged from all promises of periodical writing.
Upon the whole, I kept it beyond our expectation; nor do I think
that you have been sufficiently astonished by the wonderful effort
of the triple dispatch.</p>

<p>You must now succeed to my task, and I shall expect, during
the winter, a regular political journal of the events of your greater
world. You are on the theatre, and may often be behind the
scenes. You can always see, and may sometimes foresee. My own
choice has indeed transported me into a foreign land; but I am
truly attached, from interest and inclination, to my native country;
and even as a Citizen of the World, I wish the stability and
happiness of England, the sole great refuge of mankind against
the opposite mischiefs of despotism and Democracy. I was
indeed alarmed, and the more so, as I saw that you were not
without apprehension; but I now glory in the triumph of reason
and genuine patriotism, which seems to pervade the country; nor
do I dislike some mixture of popular enthusiasm, which may be
requisite to encounter our mad or wicked enemies with equal arms.</p>

<p>The behaviour of* Fox *rather afflicts than surprises me. You
may remember what I told you last year at Lausanne, when you
attempted his defence, that his inmost soul was deeply tinged with
Democracy. Such wild opinions cannot easily be reconciled with
his excellent understanding, but ''tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis,
'tis true.' He will surely ruin himself in the opinion of the wise
and good men of his party. You have now crushed the daring
subverters of the Constitution, but I now fear the moderate
well-meaners&mdash;reformers. Do not, I beseech you, tamper with
Parliamentary representation. The present House of Commons
forms in <em>practice</em> a body of Gentlemen who must always sympathize
with the interest and opinions of the people, and the slightest
innovation launches you without rudder or compass on a dark and
dangerous ocean of Theoretical experiment. On this subject I
am indeed serious.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I like the beginning of '93 better than the
end of '92. The illusion seems to break away throughout Europe.
I think England and Switzerland are safe. Brabant adheres to
the old constitution. The Germans are disgusted with the rapine
and insolence of their deliverers. The Pope is resolved to head
his armies, and the Lazzaroni of Naples have presented St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Januarius with a gold fuzee, to fire on the Brigands Français.
So much for politics, which till now never had such possession of
my mind. Next post I will write about myself and my own
designs. Alas, your poor eyes! make the Maria write; I will
speedily answer her. My Lady is still dumb. The German posts
are now slow and irregular. You had better write by the way of
France, under cover, directed to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Citoyen Rebours, à Pontarlier,

<h2>612.</h2>

<h3><em>To Lord Sheffield.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Lausanne, Jan. 6th, 1793.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">OF HIMSELF AND HIS OWN PLANS.</div>

<p>*There was formerly a time when our correspondence was a
painful discussion of my private affairs; a vexatious repetition
of losses, of disappointments, of sales, &amp;c. These affairs are now
decently arranged: but public cares have now succeeded to private
anxiety, and our whole attention is lately turned from Lenborough
and Beriton, to the political state of France and of Europe. From
these politics, however, one letter shall be free, while I talk of
myself and of my own plans; a subject most interesting to a
friend, and only to a friend.</p>

<p>I know not whether I am sorry or glad that my expedition
has been postponed to the present year. It is true, that I now
wish myself in England, and almost repent that I did not grasp
the opportunity when the obstacles were comparatively smaller
than they are now likely to prove. Yet had I reached you last
summer before the month of August, a considerable portion of
my time would be now elapsed, and I should already begin to
think of my departure. If the Gout should spare me this winter,
(and as yet I have not felt any symptom,) and if the spring should
make a soft and early appearance, it is my intention to be with
you in Downing-street before the end of April, and thus to enjoy
six weeks or two months of the most agreeable season of London
and the neighbourhood, after the hurry of parliament is subsided,
and before the great rural dispersion. As the banks of the
Rhine and the Belgic provinces are completely overspread with
anarchy and war, I have made up my mind to pass through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
territories of the French Republic. From the best and most
recent information, I am satisfied that there is little or no real
danger in the journey; and I must arm myself with patience to
support the vexatious insolence of democratical tyranny. I have
even a sort of curiosity to spend some days at Paris, to assist at
the debates of the Pandæmonium, to seek an introduction to the
principal Devils, and to contemplate a new form of public and
private life, which never existed before, and which I devoutly
hope will not long continue to exist. Should the obstacles of
health or weather confine me at Lausanne till the month of May,
I shall scarcely be able to resist the temptation of passing some
part at least of the summer in my own little paradise.</p>

<p>But all these schemes must ultimately depend on the great
question of peace and War, which will indeed be speedily determined.
Should France become impervious to an English traveller,
what must I do? I shall not easily resolve to explore my way
through the unknown language and abominable roads of the
interior parts of Germany, to embark in Holland, or perhaps at
Hamburgh, and to be finally intercepted by a French privateer.
My stay in England appears not less doubtful than the means of
transporting myself. Should I arrive in the spring, it is possible,
and barely possible, that I should return here in the autumn; it is
much more probable that I shall pass the winter, and there may
be even a chance of my giving my own country a longer tryal.
In my letter to My Lady I fairly exposed the decline of Lausanne;
but such an establishment as mine must not be lightly abandoned;
nor can I discover what adequate mode of life my private circumstances,
easy as they now are, could afford me in England.
London and Bath have doubtless their respective merits, and I
could wish to reside within a day's journey of Sheffield-place.
But a state of perfect happiness is not to be found here below;
and in the possession of my library, house, and garden, with the
relicks of our society, and a frequent intercourse with the
Neckers, I may still be tolerably content. Among the disastrous
changes of Lausanne, I must principally reckon the approaching
dissolution of poor Severy and his family. He is still alive, but
in such hopeless and painful decay, that we no longer conceal our
wishes for his speedy release. I never loved nor esteemed him
so much as in this last mortal disease, which he supports with a
degree of courage, patience, and even chearfulness, beyond all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
belief. His wife, whose whole time and soul are devoted to him,
is almost sinking under her long anxiety. The children are most
amiably assiduous to both their parents, and at all events, his
filial duties and worldly cares must detain the son some time at
home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LITERARY SECRET.</div>

<p>And now approach, and let me drop into your most private
ear, a literary secret. Of the Memoirs little has been done, and
with that little I am not satisfied. They must be postponed till
a mature season; and I much doubt whether the book and the
author can ever see the light at the same time. But I have long
revolved in my mind another scheme of Biographical writing:
the lives, or rather the characters, of the most eminent persons in
arts and arms, in Church and State, who have flourished in Britain
from the reign of Henry VIII. to the present age. This work,
extensive as it may be, would be an amusement rather than a toil:
the materials are accessible in our own language, and for the
most part ready to my hands: but the subject, which would
afford a rich display of human nature and domestic history, would
powerfully address itself to the feelings of every Englishman.
The taste or fashion of the times seems to delight in picturesque
decorations; and this series of British portraits might aptly be
accompanied by the respective heads, taken from originals, and
engraved by the best masters. Alderman Boydell,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and his son-in-law,
Mr. George Nicol, bookseller in Pallmall, are the great
undertakers in this line;* but your negociation with them will
require the dexterity of an Auckland or a Malmsbury, as it is
most essential that I be solicited, and do not solicit. In your
walk through Pall Mall, you may call on the bookseller, who
appeared to me an intelligent man, and after some general questions
about his Edition of Shakespeare, &amp;c., you may open the
British portraits as an idea of your own to which I am perfectly
a stranger. If he kindles at the thought, and eagerly claims my
alliance, you will begin to hesitate. "I am afraid, Mr. Nichols,
that we shall hardly persuade my friend to engage in so great a
work. Gibbon is old, and rich, and lazy. However, you may
make the tryal, and if you have a mind to write to Lausanne
(as I do not know when he will be in England), I will send the
application."</p>

<p>On the receipt of his proposal, the business will come properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
before me, and it will then be in my power to deliberate, to
demur, to state observations, and to prescribe terms. Should
Nichols or Boydell be cool, you will be still colder; I shall hear
from you the tone and motives of their refusal, and on my arrival
in England I shall be free to consider, whether it may suit me
to proceed in a mere literary work without any other decorations
than those which it may derive from the pen of the author. *It
is a serious truth, that I am no longer ambitious of fame or
money; that my habits of industry are much impaired, and that
I have reduced my studies to be the loose amusement of my morning
hours, the repetition of which will insensibly lead me to the
last term of existence. And for this very reason I shall not be
sorry to bind myself by a liberal engagement, from which I may
not with honour recede.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, we must say a word or two of Parliamentary
and pecuniary concerns. 1. We all admire the generous spirit
with which you damned the Assassins, but I hope that your
abjuration of all future connection with Fox was not quite so
peremptory as it is stated in the French papers. Let him do
what he will, I must love the dog. The opinion of Parliament
in favour of Louis XVI. was declared in a manner worthy of the
representatives of a great and wise nation.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> It will certainly have
a powerful effect; and if the poor King be not already murdered,
I am satisfied that his life is in safety: but is such a life worth
his care? Our debates will now become every day more interesting;
and as I only expect from you opinions and anecdotes, I
most earnestly conjure you to send me Woodfall's Register, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the margins cut close, as often (and that must be very often) as
the occasion deserves it.* My direction, more distinctly than in
my last letter, must be under cover to Le Citoyen le Rebours,
Maitre de Poste a Pontarlier, dans le department du Doubs.
*I now spare no expense for news.*</p>

<p>2. Will it never be possible to get me a good Mortgage for
my £3000? I believe it may be advisable to change my stock
from the Short Annuities, the value of which is wearing every
day, to the 3 per Cents., which are now so low. Notwithstanding
Sainsbury's death, I hope the Buriton interest is regularly paid;
when there is a stoppage, the Goslings might give you or me
notice that I may not be exposed to the danger of overdrawing.
I want to have Caplin's direction, as I may have some orders
that should be executed before my arrival. We have written
twice to Ostend without obtaining an answer. Have you had
no better success? I tremble for my Madeira.</p>

<p>*I want some account of Mrs. G.'s health. Will my lady never
write? How can people be so indolent! I suppose this will find
you at Sheffield-place during the recess, and that the heavy baggage
will not move until after the birthday. Shall I be with you by
the first of May? The Gods only know. I almost wish that I
had accompanied Madame de Staël.*</p>

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
Sheffield Place, Jan. 23rd, 1793.
</p>

<p>Your silence, which seemed long after your extraordinary
epistolary efforts, threw the family into a state of revolt; we
abjured writing to you until we had further information of
your state, &amp;c. Your letters of the 1st &amp; 6th (the latter rec<sup>d</sup>.
this day) promoted an immediate search for this large sheet
of paper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD SHEFFIELD ON SWISS POLITICS.</div>

<p>In respect to the French Revolution at Geneva, I consider
it in a very serious light. I am perfectly satisfied that if a War
with England does not take place, that the execrable french
demons will produce the same Revolution in the Pays de Vaud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
From what has passed lately, I have entirely changed my opinion
of the Swiss character. I no longer expect that noble resistance
which was supposed characteristic of them. This mortifies me,
but I see a greater probability of your re-establishment in England
than I had flattered myself with before. I acknowledge that no
creature could leave your spot without deep regret. It is eminently
beautiful and pleasant. Its convenience is of your own creation,
your books are there&mdash;but tho' the translation of them to this
island might cost you £400, it would not be impossible expence.</p>

<p>But war between this country and France is more certain
than you seem to think it. You could not have read Lord
Grenville's notice of Chauvelin's Paper.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> I like it much, it
seemed to show that War is inevitable&mdash;indeed letters received
this day mention it as certain, and Chauvelin's departure is
immediately expected. The Devils seem damnably afraid of us,
and I hope with reason. There can be little doubt that Spain
and Holland will heartily join and compleat the Circle of Fire,
except on the frontier of your poor Swiss. Surely it will be more
politick and more economick for us to engage, when backed
by all Europe, than to fight them single-handed hereafter.
Our merchants however affect to be panic-struck on Acct. of
our Turkey fleet, which they say is worth a million sterling. I
should not forget a strange dilemma in which we find ourselves
through a most extraordinary neglect of that essential naval
store&mdash;cordage. All the Rope-yards in England will not in a
considerable time be able to supply the quantity that is wanted.
I have the pleasure however of observing that the War is not
likely to be unpopular. Charles F. and they who bellowed most
against it certainly most wish it, because it is the only thing
that can eventually overturn the Administration. But you remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
how few join in the cry against War. None of the innumerable
declarations of Associations give the smallest hint of disapprobation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOX AND THE DUKE OF PORTLAND.</div>

<p>I believe I mentioned that I thought, if C. Fox should manage
prudently, that the Party would not suffer essentially. But he
seems totally to have discarded all attention to that respectable
and most necessary though vulgar condescension. In the Debate,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
when Sir Gilbert Elliot stated that the Duke of Portland entirely
differed from C. Fox, the latter distinctly said, that he had no
reason to think so, but if that was the case, there was nothing
left for him to do, but either to carry on the most fruitless
opposition or to quit Parliament. It is said he went next
morning to the Duke and repeated his threat to quit Parliament.
The Duke was induced to send the Marquis of Titchfield to the
House of Commons to contradict in a degree, or at least give a
different colour to what Sir Gilbert had said, although the latter
had taken down in writing the Duke's sentiments which he had
delivered to the House. It is a most serious business to cast off
or deny the Leader of the Party in the House of Commons, and
such a man as Fox, with whom he has always acted. But it
seems probable from the spirit of the times that the Duke will
ruin himself with the Publick by adhering to him. It is probable
that he will still remain enthralled with a connection which at
this moment is neither consistent with his opinions, his interest,
nor his estimation with those who have hitherto highly respected
him; should that happen, it is impossible to unite two confidences
so entirely opposite to each other, and no party can hold men
together whose views for the Publick Interest are so totally
different. The state of the times will accelerate decision. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
ambiguous state in which things were left at the time of the
Recess, must in some way be cleared up before our meeting,
which is to take place a week hence.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Every appearance indicates War&mdash;a War for the very existence
of the Constitution&mdash;half measures cannot be pursued with safety
or honour. Charles seemed disposed to support the enemies of
the country, against the country, as he and his Party did the last
War. You will recollect how it used to affect my nerves, and how
I used to execrate the conduct of Opposition. The second attempt
at the same vile game revolts me in the highest degree, and I
think it will be impossible for me ever to follow such a leader.
I have kept out of the way, yet I find the Country Gentlemen
and many others much disposed to follow the style I took up so
vigorously on the proposition being made to acknowledge the
Republick. What I then said is <em>vaunted</em> throughout Europe far
beyond what it deserves. It has been nobly seconded by the
Country Gentlemen. It certainly was not pronounced with
indifference, but with the most hearty zeal. It was a natural
effort, and probably the best of the kind I had ever made, and
the friends of Government said it was the best and most useful
speech that will probably be made this Sessions.</p>

<p>I hear since my absence that others and of high consequence
are tired and disgusted with the uncertainty of the situation in
which some of our friends have placed themselves, and with the
multiplied intrigues that have been used to keep them in that
state. In the country, by all accounts, and certainly in town,
there has been a very general consent to the measures which
have been taken to resist all that torrent of evil which was
pouring in upon us from France; and it is truly mortifying,
that those, who have done great good by their early favor to
those measures, should suffer their conduct to be obscured and
lose the credit of their good intentions. I believe I mentioned
that I had reason to suppose L<sup>d</sup>. L. would not accept the Seals,
unless there should be something like a general coalition.
But this was before the meeting of Parliament. Several of my
correspondents say that he is certainly to have them immediately.
The <em>disorganized</em> state of the Party and the wrong-headedness of
a Chief among the Commons have perhaps promoted it.</p>

<p>In respect to your passage to this country. War renders it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
very difficult. After a declaration, you, especially a notorious
aristocrate, will hardly venture it&mdash;a degree of acrimony is to
be expected, and ought to be promoted by us between the two
countries. The Rhine will not be a desireable route for such
an unweildy personage, who could not easily shift as difficulties
arose, but you might travel the road by which Mrs. Moss returned,&mdash;by
Stutgard and Frankfort, without touching upon the Rhine
till she came to Cologne. From Cologne or Dusseldörf you might
find your way to the Hague, and there our friend Lord Auckland
would contrive to amuse you till he could find a passage in a
Frigate for you to England. I by no means intend to recommend
this route to you early in the Spring, but in Summer, when
the invading armies will probably have left the Rhine in their
rear. But until they have left its neighbourhood&mdash;Frankfort, &amp;c.,
I do not see a chance of even a more active person passing that
way without disagrement. In short, I should think you rather
wild if you attempted to go to Paris, even if there were not war;
and if you were there, the uncivilized crowding at the Pandemonium
would not delight you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXECUTION OF LOUIS XVI.</div>

<p>Since this was began a letter from the D. of Richmond
announces the horrid account received yesterday from Paris, that,
the King was condemned to death on Sunday, was to be executed
on Monday,<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and that a general massacre of his friends was
expected. I have not words to express myself. Life cannot be
desireable to the unfortunate man&mdash;the abomination will in the
end be useful&mdash;the execration of the World will be uniform and
the extirpation of the miscreants surely must and will follow.
The abhorrence of their principles will be compleat check to the
further spreading of the greatest evils we have ever heard of,
and on account of the odium which shall fall on their whole
system. I rejoice that the worse than savage act should be done
by the Assembly rather than by a tumultuous mob. I can hardly
think on any other subject.</p>

<p>Another letter acquaints me that Parliament will meet for
business sooner than I expected. Dundas has given notice of
a message to come down on Monday the 31st, equivalent to a
declaration of War.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>I shall send the diary as you desire; I was astonished to
receive your letters with the Pontarlier post-mark. You may
know best; I should not have supposed France the surest way for
them, as the War cannot last. I shall not think of selling your
stock to lay it out on a Mortgage at present. I shall consult
Darrell on the rational plan of exchanging the short annuities
into 3 per Cents. I have told you more than once that I had
information of your Madeira, and that it was moving towards you
at last. Whether de Custine has since tasted it, I cannot say,
but I shall enquire. I fear some letters must have miscarried.
Mention dates.</p>

<p>I shall never consent to your dropping the Memoirs. Keep
that work always going; but you should decide whether the
book and the author are to see the light together, because it
might be differently filled up according to that decision. A man
may state many things in a posthumous work, that he might
not in another; the latter often checks the introduction of
many curious thoughts and facts. But I like your Biographical
plan very much. It will give great satisfaction, and it may last as
long as yourself. What think you of the manner of Plutarch? I
shall mention the matter to Nicholls. Well-engraved portraits
is a decoration that will be desired by all. We have a slight
work by Birch<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> which you know, and which accompanies some
very good portraits.</p>

<p>We hear with most sincere concern of the state of that
eminently honest <em>gentleman</em>, poor de Severy, and were highly
concerned for the family. It must be obvious to you that a
tolerable situation for the son, in the way you wish, becomes
every day more unpromising. Nothing but the North and part
of Germany is open, and the passage there during the war will not
tempt our great people to send their sons, and I know and you
may readily suppose that the market is overstocked in the greatest
degree by the numberless Frenchmen of fashion who are soliciting
for the office on any terms. So many solicit for them, Severy has
scarce a chance during War.</p>

<p>I saw in a Newspaper some time ago a Paragraph which stated
several circumstances concerning your present situation at
Lausanne, and added that the account came from a noble Lord.
I was a good deal annoyed, altho' the circumstance of great
incorrectness proved that it did not come from me.</p>

<p class="head">
Downing Street, 29th Jan., '93.
</p>

<p>Yesterday I dined with the Lord High Chancellor Loughborough
and his Lady just as he had returned from the Queen's
House with the Seals. I came from the country the day before
to attend the King's message, which you will see in the papers.
I am provoked to write to you a post sooner than I intended
by letters from a miserable Frenchman in Switzerland,
who signs himself Naijeiraud, chez Madame Lizardex, née Valtravers,
au Bureau d'Avis, à Lausanne. He dates his letter from
Payerne and Friburg. They contain expressions of the greatest
distress. He supposes me the Director of all the hospitable
measures in England. Enquire for him immediately, do something
for him immediately, and learn whether he does not merit
more. His letters are shocking to read. I shall not dislike to
pay you; yet as you are a rich old fellow, I am of opinion you will
take an opportunity of doing something yourself or of ordering
some subscriptions in your name in this country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOX AND HIS FOLLOWERS.</div>

<p>I observe no others going into office with Lord Loughborough.
The D. of Port. is enthralled by Charles Fox, notwithstanding he
declares he thinks as we do on the present topics, who do not
mean to follow Ch. Fox again. Many adhere to D. of Portland
however, yet highly disapproving C. Fox's conduct. The latter,
Erskine and Grey, &amp;c., were daily and publickly with Chauvelin,
&amp;c., before his departure.</p>

<p>Maret<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> is just come with credentials from the Republick, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
it is said with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i>, and to enquire whether we will receive
Dumouriez; offers to withdraw Troops from all the countries
attacked, to do what we please in respect to Commercial Treaty,
and to abide our arrangement of Peace with Europe. If this be
true, it may embarras ministers here how to treat with Pache<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> or

<h3><em>Lord Sheffield to Edward Gibbon.</em></h3>


<p class="head">
D. S., 5th Feb., '93.
</p>

<p>I obey your orders in sending the account of the last great
debate,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> by the first post. Poor Woodfall is in a strait waistcoat,
but the account is not badly given, &amp; I have examined and
find it the best. Charles F. told us distinctly that the Sovereignty
was absolutely in the people, that the Monarchy was
elective, otherwise the Dynasty of Brunswick had no right, and
that the majority of the people, whenever they thought proper to
change the form of Government, had a right to cashier the King.
Perhaps the late conduct of the Prince of Wales (you know he
has discarded Fox, Sheridan, Erskine, &amp;c.) has promoted the
utterance of these things. That which was called Opposition
seems suspended in a comical state. The Duke of Portland
adheres to Fox, and all the party disapprove Fox's conduct and
almost all vote against him. I see no symptom as yet of anybody
taking office with Lord Loughborough. I believe he is delicate in
saying anything lest he should appear to use means to take from
the Duke of P. The war is popular except among merchants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
those of London consider it as an unavoidable calamity. We are
sending Artillery to the coasts of Sussex and Kent, and an Expedition
to the West Indies. The beginning, particularly, of
Pitt's speech was very fine. Fox's not so good as usual; and as to
Windham, I should think he is become the best, at least the most
sensible speaker of the whole.</p>

Begun Feb. 9,&mdash;ended Feb. 18, 1793.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF M. DE SEVERY.</div>

<p>*The struggle is at length over, and poor de Severy is no more!
He expired about ten days ago, after every vital principle had been
exhausted by a perpetual complication of disorders, which had
lasted above five months: and a mortification in one of his legs,
that gradually rose to the more noble parts, was the immediate
cause of his death. His patience and even chearfulness supported
him to the fatal moment; and he enjoyed every comfort that
could alleviate his situation, the skill of his physicians, the
assiduous tenderness of his family, and the kind sympathy not
only of his particular friends, but even of common acquaintance,
and generally of the whole town. The stroke has been severely
felt, yet I have the satisfaction to perceive that Madame de
Severy's health is not affected; and we may hope that in time
she will recover a tolerable share of composure and happiness.
Her firmness has checked the violent sallies of grief; her gentleness
has preserved her from the worst of symptoms, a dry, silent
despair. She loves to talk of her irreparable loss, she descants
with pleasure on his virtues; her words are interrupted with tears,
but those tears are her best relief; and her tender feelings will
insensibly subside into an affectionate remembrance. Wilhelm is
much more deeply wounded than I could imagine, or than he
expected himself: nor have I ever seen the affliction of a son and
heir more lively and sincere. Severy was indeed a very valuable
man: without any shining qualifications, he was endowed in a
high degree with good sense, honour, and benevolence; and few
men have filled with more propriety their circle in private life.
For myself, I have had the misfortune of knowing him too late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
and of losing him too soon. But enough of this melancholy
subject.</p>

<p>The affairs of this theatre, which must always be minute, are
now grown so tame and tranquil, that they no longer deserve the
historian's pen. The new constitution of Geneva is slowly forming,
without much noise or any bloodshed; and the patriots, who
have staid in hopes of guiding and restraining the multitude,
flatter themselves that they shall be able at least to prevent their
mad countrymen from giving themselves to France, the only
mischief that would be absolutely irretrievable. The Revolution
of Geneva is of less consequence to <em>us</em>, however, than that of
Savoy; but our fate will depend on the general event, rather than
on these particular causes. In the meanwhile we hope to be
quiet spectators of the struggle of this year; and we seem to
have assurances that both the Emperor and the French will
compound for the neutrality of the Swiss. The Helvetic body
does not acknowledge the Republic of France; but Barthelemy,
their Ambassador, resides at Baden, and steals, like Chauvelin, into
a kind of extra official negociation. All spirit of opposition is
quelled in the canton of Bern, and the perpetual banishment of
the Van Berchem family has scarcely excited a murmur. It will
probably be followed by that of Colonel Polier, &amp;c.; the crime
alledged in their sentence is the having assisted at the federation
dinner at Rolle two years ago; and as they are absent, I could
almost wish that they had been summoned to appear, and heard
in their own defence. To the general supineness of the inhabitants
of Lausanne I must ascribe, that the death of Louis XVI.
has been received with less horror and indignation than I could
have wished. I was much tempted to go into mourning, and
probably should, had the Dutchess been still here; but as the
only Englishman of any mark, I was afraid of being singular;
more especially as our French emigrants, either from prudence or
poverty, do not wear black, nor do even the Neckers. Have you
read his discourse for the King? It might indeed supersede the
necessity of mourning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENZY-FEVER OF THE FRENCH.</div>

<p>I should judge from your last letter, and from the <em>Diary</em> (alas,
poor Woodfall!), that the French declaration of war must have
rather surprised you. I wish (though I know not how) it could
have been avoided, that we might still have continued to enjoy
our safe and prosperous neutrality. You will not doubt my best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
wishes for the destruction of the miscreants; but I love England still
more than I hate France. All reasonable chances are in favour of
a confederacy, such as was never opposed to the ambition of Louis
XIV.; but, after the experience of last year, I distrust reason,
and confess myself fearful for the event. The French are strong
in numbers, activity, enthusiasm; they are rich in rapine; and
although their strength may be only that of a frenzy-feaver, they
may do infinite mischief to their neighbours before they can be
reduced to a strait wastecoat. I dread the effects that may be
produced on the minds of the people by the increase of debt and
taxes, probable losses, and possible mismanagement. Our trade
must suffer; and though projects of invasion have been always
abortive, I cannot forget that the fleets and armies of Europe have
failed before the towns in America, which have been taken and
plundered by a handful of Buccaneers. I know nothing of Pitt
as a War Minister; but it affords me much satisfaction that the
intrepid wisdom of the new Chancellor is introduced into the
Cabinet. I wish, not merely on your own account, that you were
placed in an active, useful station in Government. I should not
dislike you Secretary at War.</p>

<p>I have little more to say of myself, or of my journey to
England: you know my intentions, and the great events of
Europe must determine whether they can be carried into execution
this summer. If * * * * *<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> has warmly adopted <em>your</em> idea, I shall
speedily hear from him; but, in truth, I know not what will be
my answer: I see difficulties which at first did not occur: I
doubt my own perseverance, and my fancy begins to wander into
new paths. The amusement of reading and thinking may perhaps
satisfy a man who has paid his debt to the public; and there
is more pleasure in building castles in the air than on the ground.
I shall contrive some small assistance for your correspondent,
though I cannot learn any thing that distinguishes him from
many of his countrymen. We have had our full share of poor
emigrants; but if you wish that any thing extraordinary should
be done for this man, you must send me a measure. Adieu. I
embrace My lady and the Maria, as also Louisa. Perhaps I may
soon write, without expecting an answer.*</p>

<p>I do not merely congratulate your lordship's promotion
to the first civil office in the kingdom; an office which
your abilities have long deserved, and which your temperate
ambition, if I am not mistaken, had repeatedly declined. My
satisfaction does not arise from an assurance of the wisdom and
vigour which administration will derive from the support of so
respectable an ally. But as a friend to government in general, I
most sincerely rejoice that you are now armed in the common
cause against the most dangerous fanatics that have ever invaded
the peace of Europe; against the new barbarians, who labour to
confound the order and happiness of society; and who, in the
opinion of thinking men, are not less the enemies of subjects than
of kings. The hopes of the wise and good are now fixed on the
success of England; and I am persuaded that my personal attachment
to your lordship will be amply gratified by the important
share which your counsels will assume in that success. I could
wish that some of your former associates possessed sufficient
strength of mind to extricate themselves from the toils of prejudice
and party. But I grieve that a man, whom it is impossible
for me not to love and admire, should refuse to obey the
voice of his country; and I begin to fear that the powerful
genius of Mr. Fox, instead of being useful, will be adverse to the
public service. At this momentous crisis we should inlist our
whole force of virtue, ability, and spirit; and without any view
to his private advantage, I could wish that our active friend, Lord
Sheffield, might be properly stationed in some part of the line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD CHANCELLOR LOUGHBOROUGH.</div>

<p>M. Necker, in whose house I am now residing on a visit of
some days, wishes me to express the sentiments of esteem and
consideration which he entertains for your Lordship's character.
As a friend to the interest of mankind, he is warmly attached to
the wellfare of Great Britain, which he has long revered as the
first, and, perhaps, as the last azylum of genuine liberty. His
late eloquent work, <cite>du Pouvoir Executif</cite>, which your lordship has
assuredly read, is a valuable testimony of his esteem for our constitution;
and the testimony of a sagacious and impartial stranger
may have taught some of our countrymen to value the political
blessings which they have been tempted to despise.</p>

<p>I cherish a lively hope of being in England, and of paying my
respects to your lordship before the end of the summer: but the
events of the year are so uncertain, and the sea and land are
encompassed with so many difficulties and dangers, that I am
doubtful whether it will be practicable for me to execute my
purpose.</p>

<p>I am, my lord, most respectfully, and your lordship will permit
me to add most affectionately, your most obedient and faithful
humble servant.*</p>

</p>

<p>We had intelligence of poor de Severy's death two or three
weeks before the receipt of your letter. I had always thought of
him as you describe him, "honourable, benevolent, and sensible."
His family must lament him for ever, and I know none more
likely to feel the loss.</p>

<p>As to the Pais de Vaud, the thorough diversion caused by the
War with England will leave it in a sort of humiliated security,
but I have little doubt, if that event had not taken place, that the
revolutionary principle would have been insinuated thro' Geneva
to the Pais de Vaud. The dereliction of character, to which the
Swiss have thought it expedient to submit, subjects them to the
whims of fortune and of nations. Perhaps, if the World should
recover its senses, it may find itself nearly as it was, except what
its dignity may have suffered; but you do not deserve to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
nation, wretches so compleatly in awe of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans cullotes</i>, that
they did not dare even to wear mourning. As for you, you are a
damned, unworthy, temporizing son of a bitch, and shall only be
deemed a renegado Englishman in future. Never was a mourning
so general in England.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> I did not (who seldom wore it in the
morning before) quit it for a quarter of a moment. I was glad to
see the lower ranks indignant, although to be sure Louis XVI.'s
fort was being a martyr. It may be also added that a more
innocent man was never more undeservedly put to death. I
should have been indeed astonished that the Neckers did not wear
mourning, if the panic meanness had not been so general in your
parts. Although I may not flatter myself that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans culotterie</i>
will be suppressed in one campaign, yet I have few doubts in
respect to the success of the Armies which attack France,
especially after the experience of last campaign. It will not be
necessary to take the beast by the horns and attack artillery
in front, &amp;c. In such a country as where war now flourishes, it
will be easy to turn an enemy, and when an Army like that
of France in such a case is obliged to make a movement, it
is undone. As to the equipment of fleets, we seem to make a
poor business of it.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Lord Sandwich in a fortnight did much more
than we have done in three months and an halfe; a timid style in
respect to pressing produces the evil.</p>

<p>I man&oelig;uvred your business in respect to Nichols in my best
possible manner. In return to my wishing he could tempt you
and that I would second, he talked most feelingly that he and
Boydell had £40,000&mdash;everything&mdash;involved in the Shakespear.
He seemed to wish to talk over such a subject when you come
to England. He thought such a work would be more than you
could undertake, suggested the idea of your being the Chief&mdash;shewed
me the Life of Milton by Hailey, prefixed to Mr. Cowper's
edition, and said that kind of writing was his fort. Persevere; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>

more at present.</p>

<p>I have sent by Seigneux, Lally's defence of Louis XVI., and
Le Songe d'un Anglois;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> you will be pleased with both. I sent

to Meluner, the Captain of Highlanders, with whom we were so
much pleased. I sent in the same parcel a number of odd things
relative to Establishments, Insurance, &amp;c., which Commissioner
Fischer might like, but I was obliged to reduce the parcel on
account of its size, and I know not whether the remainder is
worth sending to him&mdash;but you will judge.</p>

nothing to distinguish him. I have applied to those who were
likely to be useful on the subject of what you mentioned for
Wilhelm de S., but as yet without a glimpse of success. The
market is over-stocked. The travelleable country is greatly
circumscribed, and the measure of sending a leader is greatly
exploded. I spoke to Lord Porchester,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and he with great satisfaction

</p>

<p>My letter of last week did not enter on your affairs of money
because Darell had not given me a final opinion; yesterday we
had a full discourse thereon. The 3 per cents may sink more
in proportion than the short annuities. The latter have fallen
more than Mr. Darell expected, which he acknowledged when
I remarked the opinion he had formerly given you. On the
other hand, the 3 per cents are (for war-like times) surprisingly
high. The constant regular purchase of one million of the stocks
in the course of a year takes the whole of the floating stock;
the great bankruptcies which have taken place, and the shyness
of our monied men to discount Bills,&mdash;all these circumstances
keep up the Funds. The extravagant extension of credit have
produced the evil that was expected. It has been carried beyond
anything that was ever known before. The War has helped to
bring forward the crisis, but is not the cause of the mischief.</p>

<p>We seem to be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en train</i> to receive good tidings by every
mail, but I cannot be content on the subject of our Fleet. The
Publick begins to arraign the First Lord of Admiralty in respect
to alertness and attention. It is extraordinary that John Bull
bore so long the alarming state of the Mediterranean, 52 French
ships of war of all sizes riding triumphant and insulting all nations
in that sea&mdash;a superior French Fleet also in the West Indies.
I flatter myself however we are going to do something there;
nothing can prove the abject state of Holland more than the
extreme joy on receiving the pitifull succour of 2000 English
troops. The circumstance of sending the King's son<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> had the
greatest effect, and proved that England was in earnest.</p>

<p>Your late neglects have almost obliterated your famous three
letters. You do not say whether you have received any letters
from us; not the least notice is taken of Maria's or my letters.
She wrote a good deal on our Politicks, she sent my <em>much admired</em>
Foxippic copied from the Newspaper, also a detail of the massacre
of the priests aux Carmes, and other matters. The Chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
leaned from the Woolsack a few days ago, to tell me he had a
letter from you, and asked where was Rolle. I am so abominably
engaged that we seldom meet.</p>

<p>We had a very pleasant party here at dinner last Saturday to
meet Madame de Stael, the Prince de Poix, Lally Tollendal, Princess
d'Henin, Malouet, Baron de Gillier. Narbonne was invited, but
engaged. We all went in the evening to Lady Catherine Douglas,
where Madame de Stael rather astonished the Chancellor. In
conversation she disputed every principle of Government and
Politicks&mdash;a kind of tête-à-tête. There is a great prejudice against
her. She is supposed to be the most intriguing democrate likely
to set the Thames on fire. I can hardly get people to agree that
she is eminently lively, pleasant, endowed with extraordinary
mental ability, though somewhat ridiculous. She goes out of
Town Tuesday, and talks of going soon to Switzerland.</p>

<p>You do not mention whether you have rec<sup>d</sup>. your Madeira.
I have heard nothing lately of Mrs. Gibbon. I have hopes you
will soon have a clear country to Frankfort, Cologne, and the
Hague. My Lady and Maria contrive to go out daily. The

<p class="head">
Lausanne, April 27, 1793.
</p>

<p>*My Dearest Friend, for such you most truly are, nor does
there exist a person who obtains, or shall ever obtain, a superior
place in my esteem and affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LADY SHEFFIELD.</div>

<p>After too long a silence I was sitting down to write, when,
only yesterday morning (such is now the irregular slowness of the
English post) I was suddenly struck, indeed struck to the heart,
by the fatal intelligence<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> from Sir Henry Clinton and M. de Lally.
Alas! what is life, and what are our hopes and projects! When
I embraced her at your departure from Lausanne, could I imagine
that it was for the last time? When I postponed to another
summer my journey to England, could I apprehend that I never,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
never should see her again? I have often deplored the nervous
complaints which so deeply affected her happiness and spirits, but
I always hoped that she would spin her feeble thread to a long
duration, and that her delicate frame would survive (as is often
the case) many constitutions of a stouter appearance. In four
days! in your absence, in that of her children! But she is now
at rest; and if there be a future state, her mild virtues have
surely entitled her to the reward of pure and perfect felicity. It
is for you that I feel; and I can judge of your sentiments by
comparing them with my own. I have lost, it is true, an amiable
and affectionate friend, whom I had known and loved above three
and twenty years, and whom I often styled by the endearing name
of sister. But you are deprived of the companion of your life,
the wife of your choice, and the mother of your children&mdash;poor
children! The energy of Maria, and the softness of Louisa,
render them almost equally the objects of my tenderest compassion.
I do not wish to aggravate your grief; but, in the sincerity of
friendship, I cannot hold a different language. I know the
impotence of reason, and I much fear that the strength of your
character will serve to make a sharper and more lasting impression.</p>

<p>The only consolation in these melancholy tryals to which
human life is exposed, the only one at least in which I have any
confidence, is the presence of a real friend; and of that, as far as
it depends on myself, you shall not be destitute. I regret the few
days that must be lost in some necessary preparations; but I trust

forwards on my journey to England; and when this letter reaches
you, I shall be considerably advanced on my way. As it is yet
prudent to keep at a respectful distance from the banks of the
French Rhine, I shall incline a little to the right, and proceed
by Schaffhausen and Stutgard to Frankfort and Cologne: the
Austrian Netherlands are now open and safe, and I am sure of
being able at least to pass from Ostend to Dover; from whence,
without passing through London, I shall pursue the direct road
to Sheffield-place. Unless I should meet with some unforeseen
accidents and delays, I hope, before the end of the month, to share
your solitude, and sympathise with your grief. All the difficulties
of the journey, which my indolence had probably magnified, have
now disappeared before a stronger passion; and you will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>

language, and the active assistance of Severy. His attachment
to me is the sole motive which prompts him to undertake this
troublesome journey: and as soon as he has seen me over the
roughest ground, he will immediately return to Lausanne. The
poor young man loved Lady S. as a mother, and the whole family
is deeply affected by an event which reminds them too painfully
of their own. Adieu. I could write Volumes, and shall therefore
break off abruptly. I shall write on the road, and hope to find

<p>I must write a few lines before my departure, though
indeed I scarcely know what to say. Nearly a fortnight has now
elapsed since the first melancholy tidings, without my having
received the slightest subsequent accounts of your health and
situation. Your own silence announces too forcibly how much
you are involved in your own feelings; and I can but too easily
conceive that a letter to me would be more painful than to an
indifferent person. But that amiable man, Count Lally, might
surely have written a second time; but your sister, who is probably
with you; but Maria, alas! poor Maria! I am left in a state of
darkness to the workings of my own fancy, which imagines every
thing that is sad and shocking. What can I think of for your
relief and comfort? I will not expatiate on those common-place
topics, which have never dryed a single tear; but let me advise,
let me urge, you to force yourself into business, as I would try to
force myself into study. The mind must not be idle; if it be not
exercised on external objects, it will prey on its own vitals.</p>

<p>A thousand little arrangements, which must precede a long
Journey, have postponed my departure three or four days beyond
the term which I had first appointed; but all is now in order, and
I set off to-morrow, the ninth instant, with my Valet de Chambre,
a courier on horseback, and Severy, with his servant, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Frankfort. I calculate my arrival at Sheffield-place (how I dread
and desire to see that mansion!) for the first week in June, soon
after this letter; but I will try to send you some later intelligence.
I never found myself stronger, or in better health. The German
road is now cleared, both of enemies and allies, and though I must
expect fatigue, I have not any apprehensions of danger. It is
scarcely possible that you should meet me at Frankfort, but I
shall be much disappointed at not finding a line at Brussels or
Ostend. Adieu. If there be any invisible guardians, may they

to hear that I set out for England next week, and that in a
journey undertaken at the call of friendship all the dragons of
the way have already vanished. I go by Basle, Frankfort,
Cologne, Brussels, and Ostend, and I flatter myself that the
success of our allied arms will contribute every week to open my

embark from the English town of Calais. Your answer to my

some English pupill of fashion and fortune. Such a pupill will

Dutchess and yourself will exert your omnipotence in providing
some connection equally honourable and advantageous for my

the appearance of a War. Yet I hear, as I am writing, the

that the French fight with a courage worthy of a better cause:
the town of Mayence is strong, their artillery admirable; they
are already reduced to horse-flesh, but they have still the resource
of eating the inhabitants, and at last of eating one another; and,
if that repast could be extended to Paris and the whole country,
it might essentially contribute to the relief of mankind. Our
operations are carried on with more than German slowness, and
when the besieged are quiet, the besiegers are perfectly satisfied
with their progress. A spirit of division undoubtedly prevails;
and the character of the Prussians for courage and discipline is
sunk lower then you can possibly imagine. Their glory has
expired with Frederic. I am sorry to have missed Lord Elgin,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>

<p>As you know that I am now safe, well and happy at my

in my promised letter.</p>

<p>As long as I was on the road, and it was a long time, your

proportion to the real magnitude of the danger, as to the exquisite
sensibility of your own feelings. For my own part, though the
scene was nearer and more familiar to me, I must fairly own,
that I saw through a magnifyer, and that my resolution to visit
Lord Sheffield in his state of affliction was an effort of some
courage. But I was most agreably surprized to find the Lyons
whom I had seen at a distance become little gentle lap-dogs on a
nearer approach. I wheeled round behind the armies by the way
of Basel, Frankfort, Cologne, Brussells, and Ostend, without
meeting with any hostile impediment, and indeed without seeing
the face of a Soldier. My passage from Ostend was short and
prosperous, and I reached Downing Street not in the least affected
by the fatigue of a rough and tedious journey. I found Lord S.
much better and even more chearful than I could have expected:
he feels his loss, but the new scenes of public business in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
he verily wisely engaged have alleviated his grief by occupying
his mind. The Ladies are gone into the Country, and he proposes
to follow them next week. I could much have wished to visit
Bath without delay: but Lord S. will not hear of so early a
separation, and as he is the immediate object of my journey,
I must submit, unless you particularly desire to see me very
soon. Adieu.</p>

my aggitation prevented my feeling my excessive weakness, till
after I had answered your letter, which gave me a joy I shall
never again experience, at least I hope not, as I trust you will
not be any more expos'd to such eminent danger.</p>

<p>If I have the satisfaction of seeing you next month, I shall

<p>Many days have passed away, since I have received any
letter so truly, so dearly acceptable as your last. I had no
occasion indeed for any fresh assurances of that regard and
tenderness which I have invariably known and felt during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>

your own hand, and again confirmed by your letter of the same
date to Mrs. Holroyd, the clearest evidence of your health, spirits,
and strength, and I am still more persuaded that some minds
will rise superior to the infirmities which Nature has attached to
the advanced period of human life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANXIETY TO SEE MRS. GIBBON.</div>

<p>My own inclinations would immediately have carried me to
the Belvidere from Dover or London; but reason compelled me
to acknowledge that, as Lord Sheffield's unexpected misfortune
had prompted me to undertake a Journey more hazardous in
appearance than in reality, my first attention was due to him,
and that it was incumbent on me to try how far the society of
a friend might contribute to his relief and amusement. In the
three months which we have now spent together I have had the
satisfaction of finding that my labours have not been unsuccessful.
Our domestic society, which is much improved by the presence of
Mrs. Holroyd, some chosen company in the house, the seasonable
diversion of Camps and visits, and above all, the very important
business of the Exchequer bills which frequently calls him to
Mercer's hall, have seconded my endeavours, and I shall leave
him in a placid and even chearful temper of mind. As I now
find myself of less use, I had fixed my departure about the 15th
or 20th instant, but he absolutely insists on keeping me here
till the end of the month; and as we expect a very agreable
friend, Mr. Douglas, who married Lady Catherine North, I am
almost inclined to yield to his importunity. At all events, as I
shall only pass three or four days in town, you may depend on
seeing me at Bath in the first week of October. I remember
that your elegant little mansion will not admit of an additional
inhabitant, though I may be perfectly accommodated as heretofore
either in your court or over the way. But I am likewise ignorant
whether our dining together, at my Lausanne hours of two or
three o'Clock, may not be too great an exertion for your returning
strength. Should you content yourself with receiving my
morning and afternoon visits (and perhaps such an arrangement
would be the most prudent), I might be tempted to prefer the
Hotel, from whence a chair would convey me in a few minutes to
the Belvidere. I shall expect on that subject a line from yourself
or our old friend Mrs. Gould. Lord S., who is gone to town this
morning, and the young Ladies beg to be kindly remembered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>

<p>The remainder of my Journey has been as easy and
prosperous as the beginning, and I am now most agreably settled
for a fortnight at this place. The society of a very pleasing and
friendly family does not however make me forget the Belvidere,
and I wish that I could have given myself a larger scope for my
visit to Bath. Yet I have the satisfaction of thinking, that of the
narrow span I did not lose any part, and as you were my sole
object, I never deviated into any other company or amusement.
As we were almost always alone, we enjoyed perhaps as much of
each other's society in ten days, as we should have had with the
common dissipations of the World in ten weeks. I had the satisfaction
of finding and leaving you in a state of health, spirits,
and even <em>mental</em> youth, which you have the fairest prospect of
preserving to a very late period of life, and what more can either
yourself or your friends desire? My best compliments to Mrs.
Gould.</p>

<p>*We have so completely exhausted this morning among the
first editions of Cicero, that I can only mention my departure
hence to-morrow, the sixth instant. I lye quietly at Woburn,
and reach London in good time Thursday. By the following
post I write somewhat more largely. My stay in London will
depend, partly on my amusement, and your being fixed at
Sheffield-place; unless you think I can be comfortably arranged
for a week or two with you at Brighton.* An insignificant
Minister is often soothed by sops and jobbs. *The military
remarks seem good; but now to what purpose! Adieu. I

Ossory was from home at Farning Woods.*</p>

<p>*As I dropt yesterday the word <em>unwell</em>, I flatter myself that the
family would have been a little alarmed by my silence to-day.
I am still awkward, though without any suspicions of gout, and
have some idea of having recourse to medical advice. Yet I creep
out to-day in a chair, to dine with Lord Lucan. But as it will be
literally my first going down stairs, and as scarcely any one is
apprized of my arrival, I know nothing, I have heard nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
I have nothing to say. My present lodging,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> a house of Elmsley's,
is chearful, convenient, somewhat dear, but not so much as a
Hotel: a species of habitation for which I have not conceived any
great affection. Had you been stationary at Sheffield, you would
have seen me before the twentieth; for I am tired of rambling, and
pant for my home, that is to say, for your house. But whether I
shall have courage to brave *P. of W.* and a bleak down, time
only can discover. Adieu. I wish you back to S.-pl. The health
of dear Louisa is doubtless the first object; but I did not expect
Brighton after Tunbridge. Whenever dear little aunt is separate
from you, I shall certainly write to her; but at present how is it
possible?*</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE HANDS OF THE SURGEONS.</div>

<p>*I must at length withdraw the veil before my state of health,
though the naked truth may alarm you more than a fit of the
gout. Have you never observed, through my <em>inexpressibles</em>, a
large prominency <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa genitalia</i>, which, as it was not at all
painful, and very little troublesome, I had strangely neglected for
many years?<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> But since my departure from Sheffield-place it has
increased, most stupendously, is increasing, and ought to be
diminished. Yesterday I sent for Farquhar,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> who is allowed to
be a very skilful surgeon. After viewing and palping, he very
seriously desired to call in assistance, and has examined it again
to-day with Mr. Cline,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> a surgeon, as he says, of the first eminence.
They both pronounce it a <em>hydrocele</em> (a collection of water), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
must be let out by the operation of tapping; but from its magnitude
and long neglect, they think it a most extraordinary case,
and wish to have another surgeon, Dr. Bayley, present. If the
business should go off smoothly, I shall be delivered from my
burthen, (it is almost as big as a small child), and walk about in
four or five days with a truss. But the medical gentlemen, who
never speak quite plain, insinuate to me the <em>possibility</em> of an
inflammation, of fever, etc. I am not appalled at the thoughts
of the operation, which is fixed for Wednesday next, twelve
o'clock; but it has occurred to me that you might wish to be
present, before and afterwards, till the crisis was past; and to
give you that opportunity, I shall solicit a delay till Thursday, or
even Friday. In the mean while, I crawl about with some labour,
and much indecency, to Devonshire-house, where I left all the fine
ladies making flannel waistcoats;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Lady Lucan's, &amp;c. Adieu.

Brighton, Tuesday, Nov. 26, 1793.
</p>

<p>We are very much content with the account of you, especially
Mr. Farquar's. His is really excellent. As this air does not
particularly suit Louisa, &amp; as I brought a bowel complaint with
me from London and cannot bathe, the Ladies will settle at
Sheffield Place to-morrow &amp; I shall settle there on Thursday.
We shall expect you on the Thursday following, at furthest,
perhaps sooner. I suppose you write to Mrs. Gibbon, but I do
not know why I suppose it. There is little or no Society here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
I have had one pleasant dinner with Gerrard Hamilton, who is
tolerably well, and am to dine with him to-morrow.</p>

<p>I have seen an officer just come from Portsmouth, who says
that the Fleet, with Sir Charles Grey,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> dropped down to St. Helens

on board to-morrow. I understand that Lord Moira will have
from ten to fifteen thousand troops. They are to rendezvous at
Jersey, &amp; afterwards, if circumstances are favourable, their destination
is somewhere about Cancale. There are good accounts of
the encreasing scarcity of provisions among the Infidels &amp; murderers.
The garrison at Fort Louis<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> have judiciously preferred
the surrendering prisoners of War to the deadly privilege of going
home.</p>

<p>A letter from Lord Auckland talks of going for three or four
days to Lambeth soon. I have mentioned in a letter that you
proposed to pass two nights with him. I shall be sorry if you
should not see him.</p>

subject of which it is not easy to be explicit, had afforded any
events. But you may rest assured that I am now in the best

I arrived here yesterday, and shall remain in this quiet

<p>Gibbon died at 76, St. James's Street, on January 16, 1794.
He was buried in Lord Sheffield's family burial-place in Fletching,
Sussex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAST MOMENTS OF GIBBON.</div>

<p>The following account of his last moments is given by Lord
Sheffield in his edition of Gibbon's <cite>Miscellaneous Works</cite> (1814),
vol. i. pp. 422-425:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After I left him on Tuesday afternoon, the fourteenth, he
saw some company, Lady Lucan and Lady Spencer, and thought
himself well enough at night to omit the opium draught, which
he had been used to take for some time. He slept very indifferently;
before nine the next morning he rose, but could not
eat his breakfast. However, he appeared tolerably well, yet
complained at times of a pain in his stomach. At one o'clock
he received a visit of an hour from Madame de Sylva, and at
three, his friend, Mr. Craufurd, of Auchinames, (for whom he had
a particular regard,) called, and stayed with him till past five
o'clock. They talked, as usual, on various subjects; and twenty
hours before his death, Mr. Gibbon happened to fall into a conversation,
not uncommon with him, on the probable duration of
his life. He said, that he thought himself a good life for ten,
twelve, or perhaps twenty years. About six, he ate the wing of
a chicken, and drank three glasses of Madeira. After dinner he
became very uneasy and impatient; complained a good deal, and
appeared so weak, that his servant was alarmed. Mr. Gibbon
had sent to his friend and relation, Mr. Robert Darell, whose
house was not far distant, desiring to see him, and adding, that
he had something particular to say. But, unfortunately, this
desired interview never took place.</p>

<p>"During the evening he complained much of his stomach, and
of a disposition to vomit. Soon after nine, he took his opium
draught, and went to bed. About ten, he complained of much
pain, and desired that warm napkins might be applied to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
stomach. He almost incessantly expressed a sense of pain till
about four o'clock in the morning, when he said he found his
stomach much easier. About seven, the servant asked, whether
he should send for Mr. Farquhar? he answered, no; that he was
as well as he had been the day before. At about half past eight,
he got out of bed, and said he was '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plus adroit</i>' than he had
been for three months past, and got into bed again, without
assistance, better than usual. About nine, he said that he would
rise. The servant, however, persuaded him to remain in bed till
Mr. Farquhar, who was expected at eleven, should come. Till
about that hour he spoke with great facility. Mr. Farquhar came
at the time appointed, and he was then visibly dying. When
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> returned, after attending Mr. Farquhar out
of the room, Mr. Gibbon said, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pourquoi est-ce que vous me
quittez?</i>' This was about half past eleven. At twelve, he drank
some brandy and water from a tea-pot, and desired his favourite
servant to stay with him. These were the last words he pronounced
articulately. To the last he preserved his senses; and
when he could no longer speak, his servant having asked a
question, he made a sign, to shew that he understood him. He
was quite tranquil, and did not stir; his eyes half-shut. About
a quarter before one, he ceased to breathe.</p>

<p>"The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> observed, that Mr. Gibbon did not, at
any time, shew the least sign of alarm or apprehension of death;
and it does not appear that he ever thought himself in danger,
unless his desire to speak to Mr. Darell may be considered in that
light."</p>

Englishwoman</cite> (1776), a verse-writer and a well-known character at Bath,
held a literary salon at her villa at Batheaston. She held, writes Walpole,
January 15, 1775, "a Parnassus-fair every Thursday, gives out rhymes and
themes, and all the flux of quality at Bath contend for the prizes." An
antique vase, purchased in Italy, was placed on a modern altar decorated with
laurel, and each guest was invited to place in the urn an original composition
in verse. The author of the one declared to be the best was crowned by
Lady Miller with a wreath of myrtle. Selections from these compositions
were published at intervals. "Nothing here," said Miss Burney in 1780,
"is more tonish than to visit Lady Miller." Lady Miller died suddenly at
Bristol Hot Wells on June 24, 1781. Her husband, Sir John Riggs Miller,
died in 1798.</p></div>

Bishop of Derry, married, in 1776, John Thomas Foster. Her father, says
Walpole to Mann in December, 1783, though a rich man, allowed her to be
governess to a natural daughter of the Duke of Devonshire. Lady Elizabeth
Foster, writes Miss Burney (<cite>Diary and Letters of Madame d'Arblay</cite>, vol. v.
p. 225), "has the character of being so alluring, that Mrs. Holroyd told
me it was the opinion of Mr. Gibbon no man could withstand her, and that,
if she chose to beckon the Lord Chancellor from his woolsack, in full sight
of the world, he could not resist obedience." Lady Elizabeth, who, in
October, 1809, married as her second husband William, fifth Duke of
Devonshire, died March 30, 1824.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> On April 12, 1782, Admiral Sir George Rodney "broke the line," and
defeated the French under the Comte de Grasse in the West Indies, the
French Admiral and his flagship the <em>Ville de Paris</em>, the largest ship afloat
and the present of the city of Paris to Louis XVI., being taken. "The late
Ministry are thus robbed of a victory that ought to have been theirs; but the
mob do not look into the almanac" (Walpole to Sir H. Mann, May 18, 1782).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Rodney was superseded by Admiral Pigot, who was one of the Lords of

Epistles to the Rev. Mr. Mason</cite> (London, 1782). Hayley's mother was Mary
Yates (1718-1775), who married Thomas Hayley in 1740, and died in 1775.
The lines to which Gibbon alludes occur in the fourth epistle (ll. 439 to end).

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> On the death of Lord Rockingham, Fox endeavoured to force on the
King, as the new Premier, the Duke of Portland, "a dull man, but a convenient

<div class="footnote">

uncle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Parliament was prorogued on July 11 till December 5, 1782. Gibbon's
list of the new Ministry is accurate, except that the Lord Advocate, the Hon.
Henry Dundas (afterwards Lord Melville), became Treasurer of the Navy,
<em>vice</em> Colonel Isaac Barré, who became Paymaster of the Forces. "Places are
cheaper than mackerel," writes Lord Loughborough to his cousin William
Eden, July 4, 1782 (<cite>Lord Auckland's Journal and Correspondence</cite>, vol. i. p. 2).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Gibbon probably refers to the defeat of Colonel Brathwaite in the
Tanjore district (February, 1782), by Tippoo, Hyder's son, and M. Lally.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The combined French and Spanish fleets were collected in the Channel,
intending to prevent the relief of Gibraltar and effect a junction with the
Dutch. Lord Howe had already driven the Dutch into the Texel, and he
now sailed to protect the Jamaica convoy, and watch the enemy, single ships
being sent to reinforce him as they could be made ready. On September 11,

Burges, Bart. (<cite>Letters and Correspondence</cite>, pp. 59-61). The dinner was given
in Lincoln's Inn to the officers of the Northumberland Militia, who were
quartered in the Inn during the Gordon Riots.
</p>
<p>
"I invited the four military gentlemen, our committee, and six other
persons the best qualified I could meet with, among whom were my father,
Lord Carmarthen, and Mr. Gibbon, the historian, who was then at the zenith
of his fame, and who certainly was not at all backward in availing himself
of the deference universally shown to him, by taking both the lead, and a
very ample share of the conversation, in whatever company he might honour
with his presence. His conversation was not, indeed, what Dr. Johnson
would have called <em>talk</em>. There was no interchange of ideas, for no one had
a chance of replying, so fugitive, so variable, was his mode of discoursing,
which consisted of points, anecdotes, and epigrammatic thrusts, all more or
less to the purpose, and all pleasantly said with a French air and manner
which gave them great piquancy, but which were withal so desultory and
unconnected that, though each separately was extremely amusing, the
attention of his auditors sometimes flagged before his own resources were exhausted....
He had just concluded, however, one of his best foreign anecdotes,
in which he had introduced some of the fashionable levities of political
doctrine then prevalent, and, with his customary tap on the lid of his snuff-box,
was looking round to receive our tribute of applause, when a deep-toned
but clear voice was heard from the bottom of the table, very calmly and
civilly impugning the correctness of the narrative, and the propriety of the
doctrines of which it had been made the vehicle. The historian, turning a
disdainful glance towards the quarter whence the voice proceeded, saw, for
the first time, a tall, thin, and rather ungainly-looking young man, who
now sat quietly and silently eating some fruit. There was nothing very prepossessing
or very formidable in his exterior, but, as the few words he had
uttered appeared to have made a considerable impression on the company,
Mr. Gibbon, I suppose, thought himself bound to maintain his honour by
suppressing such an attempt to dispute his supremacy. He accordingly
undertook the defence of the propositions in question, and a very animated
debate took place between him and his youthful antagonist, Mr. Pitt, and for
some time was conducted with great talent and brilliancy on both sides. At
length the genius of the young man prevailed over that of his senior, who,
finding himself driven into a corner from which there was no escape, made
some excuse for rising from the table and walked out of the room. I followed
him, and, finding that he was looking for his hat, I tried to persuade him to
return to his seat. 'By no means,' said he. 'That young gentleman is, I
have no doubt, extremely ingenious and agreeable, but I must acknowledge
that his style of conversation is not exactly what I am accustomed to, so you
must positively excuse me.' And away he went in high dudgeon, notwithstanding
that his friend [Lord Sheffield] had come to my assistance."</p></div>

Latin verse. His magnificent library he left to Eton College at his death

that Gibbon was bought by a place is afforded by the following extract

a new edition in 1780, which was still more outspoken in its religious and
political views. In consequence he was obliged to leave France, and settled
in Switzerland. In 1788 he returned to France, and died in 1796.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> Early in 1781 two committees of the House of Commons were appointed
to inquire into the affairs of India. One, a Select Committee, considered
the best means of governing the British possessions in the East Indies; the
other, a Secret Committee, inquired into the causes of the war in the Carnatic,
and the condition of the British possessions in those parts. On April 9,
1782, the Lord Advocate, Henry Dundas, the chairman of the Secret Committee,
moved that the reports of that committee be referred to a committee
of the whole House. On April 25 he laid three sets of resolutions on the
table. The first set, which were postponed, related to the general misconduct
of the Company; the second set, condemning the administration of the
Presidency of Madras, was voted; the third, containing criminal charges
against Sir Thomas Rumbold, the President of the Madras Council, was also
voted. On these two sets of resolutions was founded a Bill of pains and
penalties (April 29) against Rumbold; but on July 1, 1783, a motion was
carried to adjourn the further consideration of the Bill till October 1. The
proceedings, therefore, fell to the ground and were not resumed.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the resolutions as to the general misconduct of the Company
were severally agreed to by the House on May 28, 1782. On them was
founded a resolution, calling on the directors to remove Warren Hastings,
Governor-General of India, and William Hornsby, President of the Council
of Bombay. This resolution being carried, the directors passed an Order of
Recall; but the order was rescinded on October 31 by the General Court of
Proprietors.
</p>
<p>
Side by side with these proceedings, the reports of the Select Committee
were also considered. On April 24, 1782, their chairman, General Smith,
presented a series of resolutions which were carried, and on them an address
was presented to the king to recall Sir Elijah Impey, Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of Bengal.
</p>
<p>
On November 20 and 26, 1783, Fox brought in two India Bills: (1) vesting
the affairs of the Company in the bands of seven commissioners; (2) providing
for the better government of the territorial possessions of the Company. The
first Bill passed the House of Commons on a division of 208 to 102, after long
debates, in which the House frequently sat till 5 a.m., on December 8, 1783,
and was carried up to the House of Lords on December 9. The first reading
took place on December 9, and the second reading on December 15. A motion
for adjournment was carried against the ministers by 87 to 79, and on
December 17 the Bill was rejected by 95 to 76.
</p>
<p>
On the following day the king called upon the Secretaries of State to
resign their seals; and on the 19th the rest of the Cabinet were dismissed.
</p>
<p>
The new Ministry was thus composed:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br />
William Pitt                 First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br />
Earl Gower                   President of the Council.<br />
Lord Thurlow                 Lord Chancellor.<br />
Lord Sydney           }      Secretaries of State.<br />
Marquis of Carmarthen }<br />
The Duke of Rutland          Lord Privy Seal.<br />
Lord Howe                    First Lord of the Admiralty.<br />
Duke of Richmond             Master of the Ordnance.<br />
Henry Dundas                 Treasurer of the Navy.<br />
</p>

<p>
The first seven on the list formed the Cabinet.
</p>
<p>
The Duke of Dorset replaced the Duke of Manchester as Ambassador
at Paris, and Daniel Hailes succeeded Anthony Storer as Secretary to the
Legation.
</p>
<p>
Lord Temple, the "stormy petrel" of politics, accepted office as Secretary
for the Foreign Department on December 19, but resigned on December 22.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> As soon as Parliament reassembled after the Christmas recess (January
12, 1784), the House of Commons resolved itself into a committee on the
state of the nation in order to prevent an immediate dissolution. Two
resolutions were carried: (1) that to pay out public money before the same
was appropriated by Act of Parliament was a high crime and misdemeanour;
(2) that the Mutiny Bill be postponed till February 23. It was further
resolved, that an Administration, which commanded the confidence of the
House, was peculiarly necessary in the present situation of the kingdom, and
that the late ministerial changes had been preceded and accompanied by
reports and circumstances which alienated the confidence of the House. On
January 14, Pitt proposed his India Bill, which was rejected (January 23)
by 222 to 214. On January 16 a resolution was carried, by 205 to 184, that
the continuance of the present ministers in office was "contrary to constitutional
principles and injurious to the interests of his Majesty and his
people."</p></div>

friend of William Pitt, assured the House that the Government did not intend
to advise the king to dissolve or prorogue Parliament, and that the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, if such advice were offered, would oppose it, and, if it were
accepted, would resign.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_89_89" id="Footnote_89_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> On January 16, 1784, Mr. Powys, M.P. for Northamptonshire, proposed
a compromise by a coalition between the contending parties. Fox, however,
declared that no compromise was possible till Pitt had resigned. The idea
of a compromise was taken up on the 20th by the "country gentlemen."
Stormy scenes took place on January 23, when Pitt declined to make any
statement as to the advice which he might offer the king. But on Saturday,
January 24, he stated that, while refusing to pledge himself further, the
House should not be dissolved till it had met on Monday, the 26th. Advantage
was taken of this statement to call a meeting, attended by seventy members
of the "country gentlemen" party, at the St. Alban's Tavern, to consider the
possibility of compromise on the basis of a "Broad Bottom administration."
The plan proved futile, and was abandoned February 18. The proceedings
closed with a dinner given to the seventy members at Carlton House by the
Prince of Wales on March 10, 1784.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_90_90" id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> An address to his Majesty was presented on February 25, 1784, asking
the king to take measures for the formation of such an united administration
as the House of Commons had declared to be necessary. The king replied
(February 27) that he did not think the dismissal of his present ministers
would promote such union. A second address, asking the removal of the
present ministers, was carried (March 1) by a majority of twelve, and presented
March 4. The king's answer was practically a repetition of his former reply.
A representation on the affairs of the nation, addressed to the king, was
carried by 191 to 190 on March 8, and, with this last effort, the opposition
subsided. The Mutiny Bill passed without a division on March 10, and on
March 25 Parliament was dissolved.</p></div>

representatives at Dublin in October, 1784, backed by the volunteers. The
Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Rutland, acted with vigour, and the proposed
Congress collapsed. Lord Sheffield had taken part in the proceedings

writer. One of her best-known works is a continuation of the <cite>Swiss Family
Robinson</cite>. Madame de Genlis, who claims to have been the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éditeur</i> of
<cite>Caroline de Lichtfield</cite>, tells the following story of Gibbon falling on his
knees and proposing to Madame de Crousaz, afterwards Madame de Montolieu.
She refused him. "M. Gibbon prit un air consterné, et cependant il restait
à genoux, malgré l'invitation réitérée de se remettre sur sa chaise; il était
immobile et gardait la silence. 'Mais, monsieur,' répéta Madame de Crouzas,
'relevez-vous donc.'&mdash;'Hélas! madame,' répondit enfin ce malheureux amant,
'<em>Je ne peux pas.</em>' En effet, la grosseur de sa taille ne lui permettait pas de
se relever sans aide. Madame de Crouzas sonna, et dit au domestique qui
survint: '<em>Relevez M. Gibbon</em>'" (<cite>Souvenirs de Félicie</cite>, p. 279). Madame de
Montolieu, it should be added, stated that the anecdote was entirely without
foundation (Rossel, <cite>Histoire Littéraire de la Suisse</cite>, vol. ii. p. 275).
</p>

The same story is told in verse by George Colman the younger in "The
Luminous Historian; or, Learning in Love" (<cite>Eccentricities for Edinburgh</cite>,
pp. 67-91).

At Paris, in the same year, a new edition appeared, under the title of

into English by Thomas Holcroft, and published by the Minerva Press.

Finances from 1783 to 1787. By his advice the Assembly of Notables was
convened on February 22, 1787. He laid before it the financial condition of
the kingdom, and proposed, among other measures, a land tax, the taxation
of the lands of the clergy, and, generally, the equalization of public burdens.
So great was the clamour against him, that in April he resigned and took
refuge in England. "I am entertained," writes Lord Sheffield to William
Eden, November 2, 1787, "with the reception Calonne meets with in London.

13, 1788. Sheridan's speech on the Begums of Oudh was delivered on
June 3, 6, 10, and 13. The trial was adjourned on June 14 till the following
session. "Mr. Sheridan," writes Horace Walpole, June 5, 1788, "I hear, did
not quite satisfy the passionate expectation that had been raised; but it was
impossible he could, when people had worked themselves into an enthusiasm
of offering fifty&mdash;ay, <em>fifty</em> guineas for a ticket to hear him." Macaulay's
account of Sheridan's knowledge of stage-effect, and of his sinking back,
"as if exhausted, into the arms of Burke," is based on this letter of Gibbon.
Sir Gilbert Elliot, however (<cite>Life and Letters</cite>, vol. i. pp. 206-219), gives a
different account. "Burke caught him in his arms as he sat down, which
was not the least affecting part of the day to my feelings, and could not be
the least grateful testimony of his merit received by Sheridan. I have
myself enjoyed that embrace on such an occasion, and know its value." In
his speech, as reported in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> for June 14, 1788, Sheridan
said that "nothing equal in criminality was to be traced either in ancient
or modern history, in the correct periods of Tacitus or the luminous page of
Gibbon." The story, told by Moore in his <cite>Memoirs</cite> of Sheridan, that the
orator really used the word "voluminous," is repudiated by Mr. Fraser Rae
(<cite>Sheridan</cite>, vol. ii. p. 69).</p></div>

but he had signed a warrant for the further prorogation of
Parliament from September 25 to November 20. In that interval he grew
rapidly worse, and was placed under restraint. The evidence of the king's
physicians was laid before the Privy Council and Parliament, and a motion
was made in the Lower House for a committee to search for precedents of
proceedings in the case of the interruption or suspension of the royal
authority. Pitt, on December 16, 1788, moved three resolutions: (1) that
the personal exercise of the royal authority was interrupted; (2) that the
two Houses have the right to supply this defect of the royal authority; (3)
that it was necessary to determine the means by which, during the continuance
of the king's incapacity, the royal assent should be given to bills passed by
the two Houses. The resolutions were carried in both Houses. The plan of
a regency was then submitted to the Prince of Wales, and five resolutions
embodying the scheme were proposed and carried in January, 1789. On
February 5, 1789, the Regency Bill was introduced in the House of
Commons, carried, and sent up to the Lords. It was still under discussion
when, on February 19, the Lord Chancellor announced the king's convalescence,
and further proceedings were suspended.</p></div>

offered compensation. The Convention between England and Spain was
signed October 28, 1790. "The first and great news is the pacification with
Spain. The courier arrived on Thursday morning with a most acquiescent
answer to our ultimatum" (Walpole to the Miss Berrys, November 8, 1790).</p></div>

my duty, though I have lost my friend." Burke's speech was made on the
Quebec Bill, and Lord Sheffield moved, and was supported by Fox, that
dissertations on the French Constitution were not pertinent to the question

in the preceding year concluded peace with Sweden, and the winter campaign
of 1790-91 placed the Ottoman Porte at her mercy. Great Britain endeavoured
to secure favourable terms for Turkey, and made active preparations
to enforce her efforts. The king's message to the House of Commons
(March 28, 1791) asked for an increase to the navy in order to bring pressure
to bear on Russia. But Great Britain was without allies. Prussia was
irresolute, Sweden exhausted, Denmark unwilling to quarrel with Russia,
Austria intent on recovering the Austrian Netherlands. Her protest was,
however, not without effect. Catharine refused to recognize Great Britain
as a mediator or to recede from her demands. But she made peace with
Turkey at Galacz in August, 1791, restoring all her conquests except
Otchakov and the surrounding territory between the Bug and the Dniester.
The strong opposition to war with Russia doubtless influenced Pitt. But
it is said that the opinion of the Dutch Admiral, Kingsbergen, that Sebastopol,
not Otchakov, was the real danger to Turkey, finally changed his view.
The Duke of Leeds resigned the Secretaryship of State on the question,
and was succeeded by H. Dundas.</p></div>

himself both in the Seven Years' War and in the American War

His letter to the National Assembly was written, as he states, to divert the
wrath of the Assembly from the king to himself. In it he assumed the
whole responsibility for the affair. His letter, says M. Feuillet de Conches
(<cite>Louis XVI., Marie Antoinette et Madame Elisabeth</cite>, vol. iv. pp. 469-471),
produced a deep impression throughout Europe. Three autograph letters,
addressed by Louis XVI., and the Kings of Sweden and Prussia, to the
marquis, are there quoted. After the arrest of Louis XVI. at Varennes he
fled to Coblentz, summoning officers and men to join him. He served in
the army of the Prince of Condé in 1791, and in that of the Duke of York
in 1793. He afterwards retired to England, where his <cite>Mémoires sur la

army before him into the capital (May 15). General Abercromby, advancing
towards the same point from the west, reached Periapatnam. But, owing to
the difficulty of crossing the swollen Cavery, the two forces could not unite.
A few days later, the heavy rains and want of provisions compelled Cornwallis
(May 26) to retire, leaving the greater part of his heavy artillery. At the
same time Abercromby retreated to Tellicherry on the east coast. Near
Bangalore, Cornwallis unexpectedly encountered the Mahratta horse advancing
to his assistance. In the autumn and winter months many hill-forts were
reduced on the road to Seringapatam, and on February 5, 1792, Cornwallis
once more arrived before its walls. Tippoo, on March 18, 1792, signed a

Marseilles, in fact, became a Republic which undertook the conquest of
southern provinces. In February, 1792, four thousand Marseillais marched
upon Aix, and disarmed and pillaged the Swiss Regiment of Ernest. In the
following March, they made themselves masters of Arles. Their troops,
"vraie Sodome errante," pillaged the country, and plundered, outraged, or
massacred peaceful inhabitants. Avignon, which with the Comtat Venaissin
was united to France in September, 1791, was the next object of their
attack. It had been, in October, 1791, the scene of the horrible massacres
of La Glacière perpetrated by Jourdan <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coupe-Tête</i> and the "Brigands of
Avignon." Jourdan's cruelties had produced a reaction. But in April,
1792, he was carried in triumph by the Marseillais through the streets of the
city, and restored to his usurped position as governor and commander-in-chief.
Jourdan, it may be added, was guillotined in May, 1794.</p></div>

by Beckford for £950. Beckford shut himself up in it "for six weeks, from
early in the morning until night, only now and then taking a ride," and
read himself "nearly blind" (Cyrus Redding's "Recollections of the Author
of Vathek," <cite>New Monthly Magazine</cite>, vol. lxxi. p. 307). Growing tired of
it, he gave it to Dr. Scholl, a physician at Lausanne. Miss Berry, who
visited the library in July, 1803 (<cite>Journals and Letters</cite>, vol. ii. p. 260), says,
"It is, of all the libraries I ever saw, that of which I should most covet the
possession&mdash;that which seems exactly everything that any gentleman or
gentlewoman fond of letters could wish." "Gibbon's library," says Henry
Mathews in 1818 (<cite>Diary of an Invalid</cite>, p. 318), "still remains, but it is
buried and lost to the world. It is the property of Mr. Beckford, and lies
locked up in an uninhabited house at Lausanne." In 1830 the library was
divided into two parts. Half was sold for £500 to an English gentleman;
the other half went at the same price to a bookseller at Geneva. The half
which was sold to an English purchaser was, in 1876 (<cite>Notes and Queries</cite>,

The sympathy which was avowed by leading Nonconformists with some of
the objects of the Revolution was not unnaturally misinterpreted at a period
of public excitement. Dr. Price was chairman of the Revolution Society,
which corresponded with various societies in France. Their correspondence
with French clubs was published in 1792; but it is significant that the letters
on the king's escape and subsequent arrest, sent to the Jacobin Club in 1791,
the existence of which was revealed by the answer of the Jacobins, were
omitted from the publication. Dr. Priestley, subsequently elected to the
National Convention, presided at the meeting of the Unitarian Society at the
King's Head Tavern, in February, 1791, when, among other toasts, "Thomas
Paine and the Rights of Man," and "The National Assembly of France, and
may every tyrannical government undergo a similar revolution," were drunk
with enthusiasm. Such distinguished Nonconformists as Dr. Kippis, Dr.
Rees, and Dr. Towers were also prominent members of these or similar
societies. The Society of Constitutional Whigs, who addressed the National
Assembly in the autumn of 1792, declaring that, if any attempt were made
to enslave the French people, they would die in their defence, also appealed
to Dissenters. In <cite>A Few Queries to the Methodists in General</cite> occurs the
following:&mdash;"<em>Query</em>: Does not both reason and revelation teach us, that in
order to lay the axe at the root of the tree of wickedness, we must begin with
kings and princes, and bishops and priests?"</p></div>

effect were given to Montesquieu by Servan, the Minister of War. Geneva
appealed for aid to Zurich and Berne under a treaty of 1584, and prepared
for defence. A treaty was signed, October 22, 1792, between Montesquieu
and the Republic of Geneva, slightly modified by a fresh treaty signed
on November 2. By its terms the French troops were to withdraw, and the
Swiss troops, sent by the cantons of Zurich and Berne, were to evacuate
Geneva by December 1, 1792. Clavière committed suicide in 1793.</p></div>

citizens who composed the <cite>Petit Conseil</cite> and the <cite>Conseil des Deux-Cents</cite>.
Against this hereditary oligarchy Rousseau gave the signal of revolt by his
<cite>Lettres de la Montagne</cite> (1764). Two parties were formed: one, the <cite>Représentants</cite>,
demanding a revision of the constitution; the other, <cite>Négatifs</cite>,
opposing it. In 1781 the popular party gained the upper hand. The aristocratic
party, appealing to the treaty of 1738, which only allowed constitutional
changes to be made with the sanction of France and Sardinia, demanded
the help of those two powers. A combined Swiss, French, and Sardinian
force was sent, and in July, 1782, the popular party, who had promised to
emulate the citizens of Saguntum, surrendered the city without a struggle, and
the aristocratic constitution was restored. Brissot de Warville, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Philadelphien

of the revolution.</p></div>

Meuse and the Marne, were outgeneralled by Dumouriez and Kellerman.
The Duke of Brunswick, after the battle of Valmy (September 20), opened
negotiations with Dumouriez (September 22-28) at Ste. Menehould, and then
(October 1) retreated across the French frontier. The Austrians failed to take
Lille, and, at the approach of Dumouriez, retired into the Low Countries
(October 8). Dumouriez, following them, won the battle of Jemappes
(November 6), and overran Belgium. At the same time the French troops
were masters of Savoy and Nice, and of the country between the Rhine and
the Maine. Fox rejoiced at the flight of the invaders. "No public event,
not excepting Saratoga and York Town, ever happened that gave me so
much delight" (C. J. F. to Lord Holland, October 12, 1792).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_250_250" id="Footnote_250_250"></a><a href="#FNanchor_250_250"><span class="label">[250]</span></a> The French Revolution had stirred the political spirit of the Irish
nation as, ten years before, it had been aroused by the American War. It
appealed most strongly to the people by the abolition of tithes and all
religious disqualifications. The Presbyterians of the North were Republican
in their sympathies, and ready to make common cause with the Roman
Catholics for the repeal of all penal laws and the extension of the franchise.
The United Irishmen were the growth of this approximation of parties.
Among the Roman Catholics also there was a rapid spread of the democratic
spirit. The English Government was ready to grant a liberal measure of
Catholic relief and to extend the suffrage to the Roman Catholics. At first
the Irish Government strongly opposed any change which threatened the
maintenance of Protestant ascendency. But the danger of union between
the Protestant Republicans and the Catholic democrats became apparent,
when the Catholic Convention met at Dublin in December, 1792, and a
Relief Bill, repealing many oppressive enactments and conceding the
franchise, was carried, almost without opposition, in the beginning of 1793.
The Roman Catholics, it may be added, were excluded from the Irish
Parliament in the reign of William III. (3 W. &amp; M. c. 2) and deprived of the
franchise in that of George II. (1 Geo. II. c. 9). Lord Sheffield, as a later
letter shows, agreed with the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Westmorland, in
advocating resistance to the Catholics "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in limine</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="fr">in toto</i>," and in
thinking that the suspicion, that the "British Government means to take up
the Catholics, and to play what is called a Catholic game," would disastrously
weaken the hold of the Government upon the country. Burke (<cite>Correspondence</cite>,
vol. iv. p. 32) seems to suggest that Lord Sheffield was prejudiced by
the possession of Irish property in the county of Louth.</p></div>

instructions sent to Earl Gower, the British Ambassador at Paris, signifying
his recall in August on the ground that, as the executive power was withdrawn
from Louis XVI., the credentials under which the ambassador acted
were no longer available. In the instructions, the king, while "adhering to
the principles of neutrality in respect to the settlement of the internal government
of France," considered it "no deviation from those principles to manifest,
by all the means in his power, his solicitude for the personal situation of
their most Christian majesties, and their royal family; and he earnestly and
anxiously hopes that they will, at least, be secure from any acts of violence,
which cannot fail to produce one universal sentiment of indignation through
every country of Europe." It was unanimously resolved that the paper
should remain on the table of the House. The king was sentenced to death
by the Convention, January 17, 1793. His appeal to the nation was rejected,
January 19-20, and the final sentence announced to him on Sunday,
January 20. He was executed the following day.</p></div>

now (December 27) addressed a note to Lord Grenville, as agent of the
Executive Council of the French Republic, asking whether Great Britain
was to be considered as a belligerent or as a neutral power. Lord Grenville
declined (December 31) to acknowledge his official position, but explained
the policy of the British Government. On January 18, 1793, Lord Grenville
replied to M. Chauvelin that the British Government would continue its preparations
to protect the country and its allies, and to oppose a barrier to French
views of aggrandizement and the propagation of destructive principles. On
January 24, M. Chauvelin was ordered to leave the kingdom within eight
days. He left on January 25. The Convention declared war against
England and Holland, February 8, 1793, and against Spain, March 7.</p></div>

Bill (December 28, 1792). Fox opposed the Bill; Sir Gilbert Elliot spoke
for it, and stated that the Duke of Portland was in its favour, and that the
majority of the Opposition, of which the duke was the leader, intended to
support the Government. After the debate, Elliot, Wyndham, and Fox met
at the Duke of Portland's, when the duke stated that Sir Gilbert had correctly
expressed his views. Fox, however, recovered his ascendency over the Duke
of Portland, who authorized the Marquis of Titchfield (December 31), his
eldest son, M.P. for Buckinghamshire, to confine the support of the Opposition
to this particular measure. The marquis ended his speech with an attack
upon the individual ministers, a passage added, it is said, by Fox, which
neutralized the effect of his support (<cite>Diaries and Correspondence of Lord
Malmesbury</cite>, vol. ii. pp. 494, 495).</p></div>
